Whenever I install a Firefox on a new computer I always make sure to change the
default search engine from Google to Startpage; Startpage is a search engine
which requests data from Google's search engine on your behalf, meaning your IP
address is never disclosed to the big G; consequently the big G cannot attribute
any searches you have made on Startpage to you. For this reason, using Startpage
as my default search engine is a part of my standard install of Firefox.

Whenever I want to search something on Startpage, then, all that is necessary is
to type my search query in the Firefox URL bar and press enter; the query is
then submitted to Startpage and I get my results back in seconds.

Sometimes, though, I don't always want to search for something on Startpage.
Some days I may be searching for something on Twitter, Ebay, or Wikipedia.
Instead of typing my query into the URL bar and searching via Starpage I can
instead use a nifty feature baked into Mozilla called **keyword search**.

Keyword search allows you to *specify* a search engine in the URL bar to use,
thereby allowing you to search Twitter or practically any site from the comfort
of the URL bar.

1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Search > One-click Search Engines
2. Double click any of the engines under the "Keyword" column
3. Type "@[keyword]" where keyword is a short, unique mnemonic

Great, now you've got a keyword set up! But how can you add more search engines
than what are already there? There are a few ways to acheive this: you can (1)
[browse the Mozilla
add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search-tools/) and look for
your prefered search engine; however many sites are not listed here.

In this case, (2) you will need to navigate to the page you are interested in
creating a search for and right-click on the search bar. Then select "Add a
keyword for this search", which will open a dialog box where you can specify the
keyword. Be sure to prefix the keyword with an "@" or similar symbol!

Now you can enter "@[keyword] [query]" into the URL bar to search that search
box as if you typed "[query]" directly! It's an extremely helpful tool and has
kept me more focused on the task at hand rather than sifting through my default
search engine's (sometimes irrelevent) results. It's far easier to go straight to
the source and cut out the middle-man (i.e. the search engine).

The only downside to (2) is that the keyword is not added to your "one-click
search engines" like those you download as an add-on; instead, Firefox saves
this engine in your bookmarks. My best advice is this: create a folder in your
bookmarks for all your keyword-enabled search engines; this lets you manage your
engines a little easier.
