There is an (in)famous course in the computer engineering major at N.C. State
university: ECE306 "Introduction to Embedded Systems"
([mirror of the 2018 syllabus](https://cdn.wesleycoakley.com/specs/syllabus/ECE306_Syllabus_Fall.pdf));
the course is generally taken in the third year at State and advisors always recommend
to take this course along with a light semester instead of cramming it in with other,
equally demanding courses.

ECE306 is project-based: more than fifty percent of your final grade in the
course arises from the various components of the main project (the other
fifty percent is derived from your performance on three exams).

The Project and its Requirements
--------------------------------

The project itself is actually very neat: you are given a TI-MSP430
microcontroller and several components (e.g. an IoT Wi-Fi booster
board, debugging cables, an H-bridge, motors, and a handful of infrared
detectors / emitters) which you are expected to use to complete 10 sequential projects
(each of which builds upon the last) which include the following objectives:

1. Solder all components to the TI-MSP430, booster boards and H-bridge
2. Write an operating system which exposes and leverages the functionality
of the MSP430 and attached hardware
3. Design and fabricate a chassis (with room for the wheels and servo-motors)
on which the MSP430 will be mounted
4. Design and implement data structures and algorithms which permit the
newly-constructed device to:
	1. Communicate and receive commands from a user via the wireless interface
	2. Navigate a 10-part obstacle course (while being driven by a user)
	3. Autonomously drive, intercept and follow an arbitrary black line on
	the floor

That's all to say: the final project is an **IoT-enabled RC-Car** capable of
operation in autonomous and manual modes.

Implementation Strategy
-----------------------

All code is written in C; IAR is the preferred IDE (I explain how I replaced
IAR with a home-baked GCC toolchain later); the free version of IAR comes
with several restrictions, the most problematic of these is an 8MiB hard-limit
for compiled binaries.

Firstly, pieces of pre-compiled code are provided by the instructor at the
beginning of the course: the first project focuses on installing this code
on the MSP430; the subsequent 2 projects require you to replace the obfuscated
binary with your own, self-written firmware. The below picture is taken from
my lab-report for Project 1, which familiarized me with using IAR and the
debugging tools to port software from a lab (Windows) machine to the MSP430
board.

Projects beyond the first few introduce locomotion and precision into the
car in addition to the black-line detection which is necessary for the final
project. Eventually all the pre-compiled code is replaced *except for the
LCD microcontroller code*.

Reverse-engineering the LCD
---------------------------

The LCD is attached to a breakout board which is mounted on top of the
MSP430 itself; the board only sources a handful of GPIO signals (the LCD
board itself uses a simple SPI interface to communicate with the host MCU)
and it seems that only a fraction of the useful and fun functions of the
LCD are exposed by the pre-compiled, instructor-provided code.

I hassled my professor a number of times about the code: how he did it, what
documentation did he use, even if I could see the code itself; but he never
allowed me to see even a snippet of his code, calling it a "dirty hack" and
"not good practice"; this inspired me to research the LCD and begin
experimenting with its functionality.

The LCD itself is a **EA DOGS104-A** (amber)
([datasheet](https://cdn.wesleycoakley.com/specs/dogs104e.pdf)); from a
cursory look at this datasheet, I was excited about how simple things
looked, and the prospect of doing something which nobody had ever tried in
the history of ECE306 at State excited and inspired me to replace the
provided obfuscated binary with my own LCD code.

I began by researching everything about the LCD: especially I was interested
in existing libraries written for the controller (I found no such code),
downloading and filing everything meticulously on my personal computer.
These late afternoons and weekends in the lab were meditative: I would sit
with the MSP430 on the table to my right, wired with a pair or two of cables
to an oscilloscope and a power supply on the lab bench. Whenever the
documentation was not verbose, I would run the instructor's obfuscated code
and dump the resulting voltage waveform to the oscilloscope, zooming in at
specific parts of the sample, trying to figure out what each part meant.

This process, while tedious, gave me the hands-on experience of
reverse-engineering and SPI programming that everyone else missed out on; an
example of my notes (annotated with my post-analysis) is posted below:

</a>
<figcaption>An annotated view of the waveform traced from a lab
oscilloscope; using this (and 10 other sketches) I was able to
reverse-engineer the entire initialization routine</figcaption>
</figure>

It appeared that information travelled to the LCD from the MCU in small
chunks (with delays in-between); 10 such command-chunks were sent in my
professor's initialization routine. I meticulously sketched each command in
my lab notebook and matched up the signals with the [SSD1803A
specs](https://cdn.wesleycoakley.com/specs/ssd1803a_2_0.pdf), which is the
actual controller and driver for the LCD segment.

Cross-referencing this 69-page technical document I was able to
reverse-engineer all 10 of the commands sent during the initialization
routine in my instructor's binary just over a weekend in late October.
It happens that almost none of the commands sent are necessary;
many steps simply re-assert the power-on-default parameters of the chip; perhaps this initialization is not
an "initialization" but a "reset" function, I wondered; but it didn't matter
as nobody used their LCD like this anyhow (and if they *were* stressing
their LCD to the point it required soft-reset they have bigger problems to
worry over).

It seems that the code provided to us used *delays* to ensure that the commands
reached the LCD; this is not optimal for a number of reasons.
Most importantly, code which uses *delays* often blocks execution of other
critical tasks; if the blocking code is used in an ISR then events can be
missed and normal operation can break down. I was surprised to find evidence
of blocking delays in my professor's obfuscated code (especially because he
warned us not to use such busy-waits); writing to a screen using his library,
it seemed, could introduce several milliseconds of delay, potentially causing
events to be missed elsewhere. This delay could be eliminated entirely if
one wrote code to use a ring-buffer or a similar structure instead of
feeding the bytes one-by-one.

After decoding the initialization routine and distilling it down to only the
necessary commands, I decided to write my own library of functions for the
SSD1803A. I only bothered writing code to leverage the functions *I* wanted
to use, however it is trivial to expand this library to include **all**
functions exposed by the chip; below are a few snippets from the final version of my version of
`LCD.c`: it's worth noting that I provided no mapping of my instructor's
function calls to my function calls so the library is not strictly
interchangeable (and it's likely that the hardware for future ECE306 courses
will change so such a mapping is likely to be deprecated soon). Here is a
snippet of the head of the file:

As you can see, I leveraged the preprocessor macros in C to make the commands
and arguments easier to read; the increased readability allowed me to
easily write the code which sends these commands. After
declaring these constants I go on to define some useful high-level
functions; here is a function which resets the LCD to a know state (e.g. after
power-on-reset or after a brownout):

... as you can see there are several helper functions which are called by
this initialization routine; each helper function sends one or more commands
via SPI to the LCD driver. In additon, I liberally leverage `struct` and
other C abstractions to organize and structure my code better, in a way
which is easier to read and which is similar to an object-oriented (OO) approach
to the problem; it seems that the pre-compiled code did not take this
approach to the problem. Below are examples of high-level helper functions:

[[!syntax type="c" text="""
// Toss a string on to the LCD
void lcdPrint(struct LCD *l, char *s) {
	for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) lcdPutChar(l, s[i]);

void lcdEraseContents(struct LCD *l) {
	// Reset cursor to zero position

... these are examples of high-level helper functions, which are normally
called by code elsewhere within the MCU firmware; they make life easier for
the progammer (me). Contrasting the high-level functions, I also programmed
a class of low-level functions which do the heavy-lifting by taking care of
things like SPI communication and also handle the quirks of the chip which
I discovered from the datasheet:

... I absolutely love using `struct` (as you can tell above); almost all of
the LCD's functionality is managed via this paradigm because (1) `struct`
naturally organizes data in a coherent way and (2) to add another LCD, one
only needs to instantiate another `struct`, not to rewrite the whole
library; notice that each function above takes `struct LCD *l` as its first
parameter; this provides one more layer of abstraction to the library,
permitting the OO approach which I explained before.

Interesting to note also is that I regularly use error-handling code,
something which many embedded programmers scoff at; I believe that this
approach (as opposed to taking a "halt and catch fire" approach to errors)
allows sub-fatal errors to be handled appropriately and avoid a total system
freeze (especially for non-critical errors).

Finally, my `LCD.c` file concludes with code for handling an interrupt
vector for writing to the SPI buffer; the LCD communication (and all serial
communications on my board) are handled by a number of ring buffers
declared in heap memory. The interrupt service routine (ISR) looks like
this:

[[!syntax type="c" text="""
/* #pragma vector = EUSCI_B1_VECTOR
__interrupt void eUSCI_B1_ISR(void) { */
void __attribute__ ((interrupt(EUSCI_B1_VECTOR))) eUSCI_B1_ISR() {
	struct LCD *l = &framLCD;
	struct serial_buf *s = l->sbuf;
	switch(__even_in_range(UCB1IV, 4)) {
	case 2:	// RX ready
		break;
	case 4: // TX ready
		if (!(s->wi - s->ri)) {
			UCB1IE &= ~UCTXIE0;	// Nothing more to transmit
			return;
		}
		// Put one more character on the wire
		UCB1TXBUF = readSBuf(s);
	}
}
"""]]

... this ISR is slim and fast, meaning that the time spent in this ISR is
minimized so that the MSP430 has time to do the other necessary things (e.g.
IoT communication, starting / stopping motors, etc.); this is a deliberate
design choice on my part because ISRs block the execution of other ISRs on
the MSP430 (at least by default); spending too much time handling an
interrupt may mean that some other interrupts are delayed or maybe
even never called! This is a scenario one wishes to avoid, especially when
operating within the millisecond-by-millisecond world of IoT controllers.

One intersting thing to note in the above ISR is that: I never handle the
case where I am receiving data from the LCD (i.e. `UCB1RXBUF`); I can get
away with this because the LCD never sends any interesting signals back in
typical operation; the RX case above simply ensures that the interrupt in
deasserted. The circular nature of the buffer is evident by the line `!(s->wi -
s->ri)` which simply tests if the write-index of the serial buffer
(`l->sbuf->ri`) is equal to the read-index of the serial buffer
(`l->sbuf->wi`); this is the typical implementation of buffers because
the read and write indices are advanced incrementally according to each read
and write operation on the buffer such that the indices will be equal once all
data has been read which has been written.

These RC-Cars are entirely driven by batteries, making low-power operation
an important thing to consider. I actually achieved a relatively low-power
design (a pair of 4 AAs would let me drive my car for ~6 hours continuously)
by:

1. Slowing the clock periods on the MSP430
2. Toggling the LCD backlight when necessary
3. Taking advantage of low-power states on the wireless chip

All this fine-tuning is detailed in my lab notebook (which was not a
requisite part of the course but which I found useful to have), a page of
which is provided below:

As you can see `VLOCLK` drives low-frequency subsystems (button debouncing,
motors, obstacle detection) and `DCOCLK` drives the subsystems which demand
high-frequency bands for communication (the wireless module and the LCD
module). When the car is in a software-defined "standby mode" I can easily
cut the timer to high-frequency subsystems using a special function on the
MSP430; this allows me to keep the car in a state which boots far, far
faster than if I had toggled the power switch (because the car is still
"on") while conserving power by clock-gating the important modules and
using my power budget of 4 AAs more effectively.

Driving the RC-Car with a NES Gamepad
-------------------------------------

As discussed in the introduction, one of the requirements is to be able to
control the car manually; you must be able to navigate a 10-part obstacle
course for a (significant) part of grade in the course; this course is set
up on the last day of class and you can have any (reasonable) amount of time
to complete it and the only requirements are that:

1. You may not touch the car upon beginning the course
2. The RC-Car must drive within 3 inches of the checkpoint for each section
of the course
3. Your car should not interfere with other students' while navigating the
course
4. Failure to comply with the above necessitates you starting the entire
obstacle course over from the beginning

That last day of class (the day we drove the obstacle course) was particularly
hectic; since this counted as a major part of our grade, many people wanted
to do the course as fast as possible to mitigate (1) the risk of collision
with other students running the course as well and (2) maximize the time
spent on the black-line interception portion of the course (also tested on
that day).

To facilitate the speedy completion of the obstacle course I decided
early-on to use a dedicated controller to drive my car around the course;
it seems that many people decide to drive the car around by issuing
"forward", "backward", and "turn" commands over the wireless
interface; however this routine is extremely slow in practice,
allowing students who actually *drive* their cars to speed ahead in the
course.

My NES controller in the above picture is heavily labelled with the mappings
which I designed for each button: the DPad causes the car to move in the
particular direction, while the L and R buttons toggle some features on the
LCD; furthermore the two middle buttons calibrate the on-board A2D
converters for intercepting the black line and the remaining four buttons
cause the car to follow an according arc-and-intercept routine for the final
part of the obstacle course.

I finished the course in under 10 minutes because the precision of my
controller outpaced every other car. Because the wireless access points were
border-line overloaded by the mass of students present, many people were
forcibly disassociated from the AP; the lack of error handling in many
students' firmwares left their car immobile on the course, forcing them to
retrieve it (by hand) and retry the course from the beginning; my firmware
includes the necessary error-handling routines which (aggressively) attempt to
re-associate with the AP it was connected to; this ensured that my car never
stalled on the course for more than the time it took to reassociate with the
AP (normally less than one second).

Migrating from IAR to a GCC-based toolchain
------------------------------------------

One prolonged antagonist in ECE306 is the 8KiB code-size limit in IAR; with the
free version of IAR Embedded Workbench, the size of the firmware may not
exceed 8KiB in total (Kickstart IAR refuses to flash firmware images larger
than this with the error "size limit exceeded"). Of course the MSP430 has
much, much more memory than 8KiB; I wanted to break into this extra memory
to store things like wireless profiles and motor configurations which would
allow me to fine-tune the motors *en-route* without ever laying a finger on
the RC car.

I knew IAR could not accomplish this (and I was not about to shell out the
several hundred dollars for a license); additionally I cannot run IAR on my
laptop; a GCC-based toolchain suits my development environment far, far
better. Unfortunately nobody had ever done this in the history of the course
either (two firsts!) so I set off on this journey alone.

The details of my development environment are boring but involve a
TI-provided version of GCC called `MSP430-GCC` and a flashing / debugging
tool called `mspdebug`; these two softwares form the core of my development
environment; all compilation was done on my personal (Gentoo/Linux) laptop
pictured above and the source-code is edited using my favorite text-editor
[JoE (Joe's Own Editor)](https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io).

Moving away from IAR has the following benefits:

- No 8KiB code limit
- Use any text editor / IDE you want
- Integrate into your existing development environment
- Easily use version-control software (Git, SVN etc.)

Replacing the pre-compiled `LCD.c` code as above was the final barier
preventing me from jumping straight in to a GCC-based toolchain; after
reverse-engineering the LCD driver and (re)writing the interface I was
finally able to develop 24/7 on my Linux computer.

Results
-------

I am proud of my final project: I wrote *every last line of code* myself and
I'll own all the paradigms, quirks, and data-structures. The extra work I
invested in this course has taught me more about embedded systems than I
would ever have learned just by sitting in the lecture hall; if I had to do
it all again I'd do exactly the same things.
