Here's a breakdown of all pages on this wiki. This is definitely the least-cool
way to browse the site; I find it more fun to just keep clicking on the blue
links and wander around but this is provided to give less-accessible pages some
visibility too.

[[!map  pages="*
	and !(ikiwiki or ikiwiki/*)
	and !*.*
	and !img
	and !recentchanges
	and !smileys
	and !wikiicons
	and !shortcuts
	and !index"
]]
