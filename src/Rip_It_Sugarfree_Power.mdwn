[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Rip It Sugar-Free Power"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Sugar-free Power was actually my introduction to Rip Its and fucked up energy
drinks in general. The can caught my eye from a Dollar Tree shelf for its Y2K-
adjacent design and immediately after tasting I was hooked.

On the nose it tastes like a harsh, artificial soda. But with no definite flavor
it's no more upsetting than sparkling water with a bitter aftertaste. The
carbonation gives it a fine, velvety texture. Its price point is unbeatable,
unapproachable, un-dethroneable by anyone else: at $1.25 there is no cheaper
energy drink that can send you 0 to 100 so quick. It has only 160mg of caffeine,
same as a [[Rockstar]], but it gets me so much more wired.

If there is any one conspiracy theory I actually believe it's that they put
*something else* in the Rip Its they don't advertise on the can.
