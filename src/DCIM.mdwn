I take pictures with my phone like a plebian. I *want* a DSLR camera but
I'm very uninformed about which I should buy and whether I should research
a good mirrorless model instead of a DSLR. Additionally I'm not sure if I will
enjoy toting a heavy camera around my neck (or in a bag) just to get some good
snaps.

[[Vacationing in Tōkyō this Summer|Tokyo_23]] one of my friends brought along his
DSLR camera and I was extremely impressed with the picture quality. Phones
cannot compete against even an entry-level camera because of the physical
restraints on lens length and accuracy in smartphones.

I host a curated set of pictures I have taken or have been involved in the
process on a subdomain, [gallery.wesl.ee](https://gallery.wesl.ee/gallery). It
even has its own page about it on this wiki, [[gallery.wesl.ee]]
