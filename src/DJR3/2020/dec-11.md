I've been experimenting with DJ sets in Garry's Mod since my first set in May.
Recently (you may know) I've written [a number of Workshop
add-ons]()
for Garry's Mod to make it easier to stream and host parties in a game which was
not designed to do any of this.

After refining my workflow and optimizing (in particular) the camera by setting
dynamic linear and angular velocities to avoid the choopy motion which was
apparent in my prior DJ set, this time we were able to achieve an extremely
smooth and high-quality stream for everyone watching at home, while also
presenting an immersive and synchronized experience between GMod players and the
DJ at the head of the party.

Not captured in these VODs is the time we spent together shooting the shit after
the party. The map I designed is a replica of an apartment I lived in about 2
years ago so we lazed around the apartment in the post-party haze. I believe 3
of us were in VR using Catse's VRMod, the rest were playing via keyboard. I
really think that until GMod 2 is announced, VRMod is as close as we will get
to a VR-ready "title" which offers the extensibility and moddibility that GMod
offers.

Also I believe this was my first time offloading the server onto my VPS... I
think it handled everyone fine though; it was a fun Friday night!
