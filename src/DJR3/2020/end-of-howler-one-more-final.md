After three years of operation, the [NCSU Imageboard
Howler](https://howler.space) shut down. Because we couldn't meet up in-person
anymore, as the university was closed for the rest of the semester, we decided
to throw a rave in Garry's Mod. To my knowledge this hasn't been done before and
it required a handful of
[open-source](https://github.com/yumi-xx/gmod-streamstage)
[tools](https://github.com/yumi-xx/gmod-motd) that I wrote to help facilitate
the music and atmosphere of the party. After the music was over we played
Trouble in Terrorist Town on the same server until the website shut down.

If you're interested in the history of the Howler imageboard, there is a
[write-up on my main
site](https://prettyboytellem.com/writing/2018/Jan/History%20of%20Howler.html).

I'm glad we shared this experience together.
