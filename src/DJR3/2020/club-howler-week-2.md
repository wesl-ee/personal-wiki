After hosting our [first virtual
party](https://djr3.org/sets/2020/end-of-howler-one-more-final.html) we decided
to continue the tradition and open the server every Saturday at 8P (EDT) for a
weekly round of Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT). On top of this we've invited
people in our community to DJ a pre-party of sorts in the same space we hosted
the world's first live-DJ'd rave in Garry's Mod. We hope to host several more
parties like this in the future.

If you are interested in joining, check out the details [on the Club Howler
site](https://club.howler.space/), all the information about events is posted
there.
