There's a little place in Fairfax, Virginia under a bar. It hosts music every
Wednesday night. It's been around since 2004. The bar is [The Auld
Shebeen](https://theauldshebeenva.com/), The venue is
[Transit](https://www.facebook.com/Transit.GiveProductions/).

I was invited to play Transit along with some old and some new friends:
Bushmaster, my roomate in [[college|North_Carolina_State_University]] and with
whom I've DJ'd since my second time ever touching decks at [[SUBSYSTEM 20XX in
2019|DJR3/2019/SUBSYSTEM_20XX]], played right before me at this event. Two other
friends whom I've known for a bit over a year,
[mercury.lamp](https://twitter.com/a_nrvnqsr) and
[suzubrah](https://twitter.com/suzubrah), played later in the night.

Equipment was 2x CDJ 3000 coupled with an A9 mixer. I'd never played on CDJ 3ks
before and, briefly before going up, discovered my USB was non-compliant. Before
the event I had made an ordered playlist in Rekordbox with tracks I was going to
play for the night but for whatever reason the playlist, along with the cue
points I had set, did not appear on the decks when I plugged in my USB. Luckily
I was still able to browse the USB and select tracks by filename. Fuck it, we'll
do it live. So I did.
