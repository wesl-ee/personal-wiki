DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE was a party in VRChat organized by DJ's United and
featuring collaboration with EVA Online to celebrate the release of [R O C K Y's
Euphoria EP](https://soundcloud.com/rockymusic339/sets/euphoria-ep). This was
by far the longest time I'd ever spent consecutively in VR, by the end of it
we'd been talking and dancing and playing music for something like 7 hours. My
trackers died twice and my headset and right controller were nearly dead at the
end but it was an extremely fun night.

I'd like to do VR events / crossovers like this more often. The nice thing about
games like VRChat or Garry's Mod is that you can play them with a headset or
just on keyboard, there were plenty of people that night doing either. Just
having everyone in the same "virtual" room creates such a warm and close
atmosphere despite being maybe thousands of miles away from many of the people
there. There's feeling of closeness, especially in VR where you can see
everyone's body language, that makes experiences like this very special to me.
