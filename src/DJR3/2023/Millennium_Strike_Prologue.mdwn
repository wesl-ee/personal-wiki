Millennium Strike hosted two days packed full of DJs in Chicago this weekend in
October, 2023. I was given the chance to play one alongside Bushmaster, with
whom I've been playing sets for years.

And wow, this is the first IRL set in front of more than 5 people! I had a
great time playing and putting together the visuals. I also wore a crop top I
re-hemmed myself from an Old Navy pull-over despite how cold it was outside
because the venue was so hot after hours of dancing.
