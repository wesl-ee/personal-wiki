[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Venom Energy Mango"]]
[[!tag Review Energy_Drink]]

I see [Venom Energy](https://www.venomenergy.com/) cans rarely. It's a Keurig Dr.
Pepper brand and presently the only energy drink brand the company owns almost
outright outside of [[Ghost|Ghost_Energy_x_Warheads_Sour_Black_Cherry]][^1].
They own stake in [[C4|C4_Jolly_Rancher_Green_Apple]][^2] and have distribution
deals with [[Black Rifle Energy|Black_Rifle_Energy_Wild_Frost]] and Bloom energy.

Unlike these deals and acquisitions Venom was launched in-house by then-named
Cadbury Schweppes Snapple Beverage Company in 2001[^1] with a relaunch in 2008
after Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverage was spun out from Cadbury Schweppes as
Dr Pepper Snapple. Venom has incredibly poor distribution, probably because KDP
got its ass kicked for years in the energy drink department. I wouldn't be
surprised if Venom is sunset in the next few years. Or maybe they'll forget it
exists and keep it silently on shelves forever, as they basically have since it
launched in 2001.

Mango Venom has fine, velvety carbonation. The flavor is wildy sweet, slightly
sour. The sugar and citrus reminds of those fantastic, over-the-top Japanese
parfaits that are tropes in your favorite gacha's official art ([[!danbooru
parfait+official_art desc="Danbooru:parfair+official_art]]). The taste is like a
citrus parfait topped with orange and mango and lemon dissolving into a sugary
hell of cream and blended fruit below. It's fine but hard to drink if you're not
expecting it.

At 40g of sugar per 16oz Venom, this drink has less sugar than a [[Rockstar]] of
equal size. Thanks to the sucralose and citric acid it tastes way more sweet
than one, and is almost on-par with [[Raptor_Energy]]. Surprising.
