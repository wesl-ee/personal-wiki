[[!tag Aesthetics]]

Just for funsies sometimes I pipe pictures of myself into a locally available
Stable Diffusion model. When I use the keyword `boy` in the img2img workflow in
almost any context I receive back a hairy, muscular man; only halfway what I
intended.

</div></figure>

Often I find it necessary to (1) prompt the model with `girl`,
`feminine` etc. with sufficient denoising to get the intended effect, then I (2)
go back over the results and inpaint the face with significantly less denoising
to adjust the proportions to seem a bit more masc.

But the intermediate results, between these two steps, leaves me feeling funny
sometimes.

*Stable Dysphoria (noun): a state arising from conflict between the sex a person
was identified as having at birth and what that person sees after fucking around
with pictures of themselves in Stable Diffusion's img2img pipeline for a few
hours.*
