[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Gorilla Mind is probably the funniest name you could attach to an energy drink.
The packaging is heat wrapped very sloppily to the can. It has the _Gorilla Mind
Energy Matrix_ which has 6 different ingredients, the heavy lifter of which is
200mg of caffeine. The _Energy Matrix_ includes NAC and l-theanine; the rest of
the ingredients in this matrix I have never heard of.

It seems like Gorilla Mind is a workout supplement company first that makes
energy drinks as a plus on top. They'll sell you a Sea Moss Elixir if you'd
like.

I don't like how the _Energy Matrix_ makes me feel. I'm not sure if it's just a
symptom of being tired today or if it is something in the matrix interacting
with me, but I was vagugely uncomfortable for about 30 minutes after downing
half the can. It's not the same uncomfortable to me as beta-alanine, but it's
definitely from the can.

On the nose this smells like Sprite, or more accruately Squirt. It's not
offensive. The taste is tart. Exceptionally hard carbonation gives it a punch on
the sour front note. This was given as a gift to me but knowing it now I would
not buy it on my own.
