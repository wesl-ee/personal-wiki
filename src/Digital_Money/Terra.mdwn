Terra is a blockchain which focuses on [[Decentralized_Finance]] and which
originally featured a number of algorithmic stablecoins, each pegged to a national /
international currency; these stablecoins facilitated transactions on the network
and, along with Terra's native token LUNA, maintained the stablecoin peg by
allowing users to [arbitrage](https://youtu.be/KqpGMoYZMhY) across currencies.

Terra was built on the Cosmos SDK & the Tendermint Consensus algorithm; its smart
contracts are typically written in Rust which are then compiled down to
[CosmWasm / Web Assembly](https://github.com/CosmWasm). In October 2021 Terra
enabled [Inter-Blockchain
Communication](https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-enable-ibc-for-terra/2146)
to allow communication with other IBC-enabled projects like Cosmos Hub and
Osmosis.

In May 2022 Terra, then the third largest DeFi ecosystem by TVL, collapsed
[spectacularly](https://time.com/6177567/terra-ust-crash-crypto/) wiping out
over 30 *billion* dollars of capital invested in the ecosystem overnight.
Vitalik recently wrote some [about UST's
collapse](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/05/25/stable.html).

The Terra chain was developed and deployed by Terraform Labs and many projects
on Terra's blockchain were incubated by capital from TFL. Some of the most
notable DeFi projects on Terra were:

+ [Anchor](https://anchorprotocol.com/), a decentralized money-market offering
  20% APY on stablecoin deposits
+ [Mirror](https://mirror.finance/), which mirrors real-world stocks
+ [Pylon](https://pylon.money/), enabling project launches through crowd-funding
+ [Orion](https://orion.money/), which exports Anchor's 20% yield to other chains
+ [Astroport](https://astroport.fi/), Terra's next-gen AMM
+ [Mars protocol](https://marsprotocol.io/), trustless lending protocol

... I [[worked with Levana|Levana]] to create the first perpetual
swap protocol on Terra |･ω･｀) we were nearly ready to launch our swap
product (we deployed our public beta and had plans to launch in June) when
the ecosystem imploded.

It was sad to watch one of the most promising DeFi ecosystems crumble in
real-time as UST lost its peg and its collateralizing asset, LUNA, rapidly
devaulued and lost its ability to back the circulating UST. I'm thankful Levana
and some other protocols came out the other side alive but many protocols that
built on Terra were burned so bad they simply abandoned their projects. Some
had their entire treasuries locked in Anchor, the magical 20% yield machine,
and they could only watch as their UST "stablecoin" devauled 95% over only a
few days.

I was rekt personally but I came out alive somehow, and am lucky to have
invested myself in a company that didn't keep its entire treasury in UST.
