[gallery.wesl.ee](https://gallery.wesl.ee/gallery) points to an instance of
[pigallery2](https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2) running on a Kubernetes
cluster in my home. It is the first meaningful project I am running on
Kubernetes which I've begun in earnest to use in order to learn it more
intimately than interacting with it in a managed cloud environment like AWS EKS.
