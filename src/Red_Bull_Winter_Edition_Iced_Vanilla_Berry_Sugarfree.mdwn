[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Red Bull Winter Edition Iced Vanilla Berry Sugarfree"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

This is the sugarfree variant of [[this year's Winter Edition Red
Bull|Red_Bull_Winter_Edition_Iced_Vanilla_Berry]]. It is rare to have a
sugarfree variant of one of the seasonal flavors. The normal Winter Edition this
year is amazing.

The sugarfree tastes significantly different than the non-sugarfree Winter
Edition. The vanilla note is much stronger, the berry is more muted, and overall
it tastes very artificial. Thanks, aspartame, at least there is no sugar in this
one. Still, given the choice between this and the sugary variant, I'd choose the
sugary one every time.
