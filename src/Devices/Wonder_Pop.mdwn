wonder-pop is a Lenovo X61 tablet and is what I consider my “daily” laptop. I
don't take it with me when I travel because it's hefty (about 3.75 pounds).
Additionally it has about 50 minutes of battery life meaning that it's more akin
to a “mobile desktop” than anything else, though this battery life will likely
2x once I upgrade its battery, and unintentionally its weight.

This computer was [[North_Carolina_State_University]] surplus equipment and was
sold to me for $10 in August 2018. I keep the original surplus equipment price
tag on the back though it's quite faded now.

Additionally I own an X6 Tablet Ultrabase which docks to the bottom of this
tablet and which extends the functionality to include:

+ (1) serial port
+ (1) parallel port
+ (1) additional VGA port
+ (4) extra USB ports
+ Optical disk drive (MATSHITA UJDA775)
+ (1) additional RJ-11 (telephone) jack
+ (1) additional RJ-45 (ethernet) jack

The tablet functionality has been really nice working with my
[[318ti|BMW_318ti]]. I can fold the computer in half and lay it in the passenger
seat while still on and connected to my OBD-II port in the cabin, scraping
real-time data from the ECU as the car pushes the tachometer through its range.

The serial port is necessary to access further modules within this E36 unless
one jumps some pins in the 20-pin Pacman connector under the hood. A K+DCAN tool will
do this without needing to jump those pins too. Modules which are inaccessible
are things like the instrument cluster, airbags, ABS + traction control and the
“comfort” features like making headlights flash during key FOB activation and
other small things like this which are programmed with NCSExpert coding.
