I held out for the Pixel 7a for a very, very long time, entranced by the idea of
a "budget" Pixel that used the same chip as its Pixel 7 friends. The Pixel leaks
that circulated the Internet since at least July of the year before, 2022, left
almost nothing to the imagination w/r/t the 7a's specs. I owned a 4a for at
least 3 years before this and I was ready to sacrifice myself on the 7a altar.

But... the I/O reveal came and went and the pricing of the 7a was underwhelming:
$500 upfront or $20.79/mo for 2 years then $250 back after those 24 months. $250
off after 2 years was... a comical deal in this high interest-rate environment
for a neutered phone. At the same time the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 was available
for $600 or $25/mo for 2 years. You know which path I took.
