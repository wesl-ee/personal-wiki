[[!tag Personal_Device Japan]]

This laptop is a Lenovo x240 I bought while studying in Japan at
[[Sophia_University]] from one of the shrinking number of hobbyist electronic
shops in Akihabara. The fact that the Kensington security lock is ripped out of
the chassis gives me no doubt how this laptop ended up in this shop.

Unfortunately the keyboard's “s” key stopped working making necessary the
replacement of the entire keyboard. Because the Japanese keyboard was probably
the only reason I bought this computer I decided to retire the x240 after this
mishap.
