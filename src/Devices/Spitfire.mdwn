Spitfire was the name of the desktop I used throughout most of college. Spitfire
eventually morphed into [[Shepherdess]] which like the Ship of Theseus is now a new
machine entirely after having every part replaced over time.

While using the name “spitfire” these were the machine's specs:

+ Intel Core i5-4590 CPU
+ Radeon 5850 GPU
+ 8GiB RAM
+ 1TiB HDD
+ HAF 912 case
+ 2 Dell 4:3 monitors (2560x1024)
+ Unicomp PC 122 Buckling Spring “Model M” keyboard

*Aside: my first step into [[cryptocurrency|Digital_Money]] was mining Dogecoin with that beast of
a GPU in January 2014. I donated my first bag of coins to the [Jamaican bobsled
team](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1virfc/lets_send_the_jamaican_bobsled_team_to_the_winter)
and the [NASCAR
sponsporship](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/21c5xq/doge4nascar_is_funded/).*

Software workflow on this machine involved the following programs:

+ Gentoo Linux
+ dwm as an X11 window manager
+ urxvt as a terminal emulator
+ JoE (Joe's Own Editor) as text editor
+ mpd + ncmpc for playing music through Pulseaudio
