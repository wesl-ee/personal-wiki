Shepherdess is the name of my present desktop. Gradually it was assembled from the
remains of [[Spitfire]] but is now a new machine entirely. It is a level 1
hypervisor using Arch Linux (btw) as the host and running any number of virtual
machines on top of it, passing through the GPU to those machines which I use as
full-blown desktops.

You can see this desktop in the most recent photospheres of my [[Workspace]].

Sometimes I get in trouble with anti-cheat engines for running on a hypervisor.
Present virtual machines running on top of shepherdess with periphieral passthrough
(including GPU) include:

+ NixOS, for most stuff (hostname “divinity”)
+ Windows 10, for VR games because I have an HTC Vive Pro 2 with no Linux support
+ Windows ME, for fun!

Present hardware specs are as below:

+ MSI NVIDIA RTX 3090 (formerly an FE RTX 3070) GPU
+ Intel i9-11900K CPU
+ 80GiB RAM
+ 2〜3 16:9 monitors with only the center one placed landscape

Absurd RAM and GPU needed for local AI imagegen + textgen.

Because this is a hypervisor I don't run any desktop environment on the
bare-metal. But here is how my Linux box is configured on top of this
hypervisor:

+ NixOS + home-manager (formerly Gentoo)
+ awesomewm as a window manager on X11
+ alacritty as a terminal emulator
+ mpd + ncmpcpp for music playback through
+ stable-diffusion-webui for AI imagegen
+ text-generation-webui for AI textgen
