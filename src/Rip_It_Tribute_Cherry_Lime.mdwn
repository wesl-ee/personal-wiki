[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Rip It Tribute Cherry Lime"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

I picked this one up at a Dollar Tree. I avoid it because I know it is
absolutely the worst but today it's the only one they had.

Like many things you'll find in a convenience store draped in the American Flag
this drink tastes absolutely terrible. It's very heavy on the artificial cherry.
The high sugar content leaves a distinct stickiness on the tongue. Although it's
called "Cherry Lime" I don't taste much lime here. Very artificial and by far
the worst of the Rip It flavors I've had. With 160mg caffeine, 51g sugar and the
most obnoxious artificial cherry taste you'll see this side of Robitussin this
is an energy drink to avoid unless absolutely necessary.
