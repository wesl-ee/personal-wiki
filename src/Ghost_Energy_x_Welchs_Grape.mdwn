[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Ghost Energy x Welch's | Welch's Grape"]]
[[!tag Review Energy_Drink]]

This flavor was released on Sep 1, 2024. I got try it almost as soon as it was
released. Ghost has had an amazing track record with the drinks made in
partnership with brands. Their generics are whatever, not very interesting, but
flavors like [[the Warheads one|Ghost_Energy_x_Warheads_Sour_Watermelon]] blew
me away.

As soon I took a sip the first time I thought: Holy shit. This is so good. It is
hard to believe that it's sugar-free and stilltastes so much like Welch's Grape
juice. Zero percent juice. The citric acid is not overpowering; the fine
carbonation, like the carbonation in the [[Blue Sour Patch Kids
flavor|Ghost_Energy_x_Sour_Patch_Kids_Blue_Raspberry]], suits this flavor very
well. I wouldn't call it sour relative to other flavors they have, but coming
from a tamer energy drink it probably tastes still pretty sour.

Highly recommended.
