Drinks labeled "Zero Sugar" and "Sugar Free" have minimal sugar compared to the
original variety of the drink. 

The "Zero Sugar" type tries to mimic the flavor of the original as closely as
possible. The "Sugar Free" type is generally its own flavor profile. This
extends to diet and zero sugar sodas too, where diet (like Diet Pepsi) is its
own unique flavor and the zero sugar (like Pepsi Zero) is a low-calorie replica
of the original drink's flavor.

Please do _not_ ask me what the Pepsi Max is, I do not know.
