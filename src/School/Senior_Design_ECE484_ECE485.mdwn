In the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at N.C. State, there is a
requisite two-semester "Senior Design Project" class, ECE484 (first semseter)
and ECE485 (second semester).

Course Structure
----------------

During the first semester of the course (ECE484), projects
are presented to students by various university and corporate sponsors; students
must select a project to work on and design (in teams), from the ground up, a detailed and
thorough solution to the problem statement. Additionally they must make serious
steps towards the construction of a working and demonstrable prototype to
present to the course instructors, sponsors, and the public. Emphasis is placed
on maintaining open and regular communication with the project sponsor, taking
meeting minutes as necessary and drafting verbose and exact project
requirements, implementation strategies, and near- (<2 weeks) and far-future (>2
weeks) goals to achieve.

During the second semester (ECE485), students must improve on the prototype constructed
during the first semester and revise project goals and requirements, adjusting
stretch-goals and core requirements to fit sponsor expectations weighed against
the realization of the first-term prototype, perhaps shifting some goals (with the
sponsor's consent) to become stretch-goals, deciding which areas and aspects of
the project need the most attention most immediately. The goal of ECE485 is to
produce a fully-functioning demonstration which meets all of the core
requirements laid out in ECE484; this will involve heavy modification of the
prototype and further communication with the sponsor.

Emphasis in ECE485 is placed on week-by-week goal-setting and accomplishment,
project management, and regular presentations by teams to the course instructors
(emulating corporate presentations to a managerial staff) wherein short-term
progress, recent problems, and long-term progress towards the construction of
the final product is organized and summarized in a format fitting a short
presentation with a small, invested audience. Projects are presented by the
teams at the end of the semester at the McKimmon center to sponsors, course
instructors, and the public at large.

For those teams backed by a corporate sponsor, some effort is also spent by the
students to hand-off projects in a secure and timely manner to the people in the
sponsor's company who will be continuing the project.

My Experience
-------------

My team was sponsored by a corporate sponsor (and I am not exactly at leisure to say
which one); ultimately I enjoyed the freedom that working with a non-University
sponsor gives. I understand that some teams sponsored by the University had
core requirements added and removed at the will of their sponsors, largely
graduate students and tenured professors and researchers, and were forced to
work around that added pressure.

Here is an excerpt from our core requirements document, established very early
in the first semester:

[[!syntax text="""
The goal of this project is to develop a tool that will automate the sequencing
of a mobile device through a series of pre-configured, interactions with the
device to simulate a human operator.  To achieve this goal, the final system
should be able to fulfill the following requirements list.

1. General Operation Requirements and Features:
REQ-1.1: The sequencer shall have the ability to simulate operator physical
actions, activating the touch screen (touch), side keys, home keys, and/or soft keys.
REQ-1.2: The sequencer shall have the capability to receive images from the
device screen as part of the sequencing feedback.
REQ-1.3: The sequencer shall perform a fixed sequence of steps for a specific make, model, or
function.
REQ-1.4: The sequencer shall be able to store multiple make, model, or
function sequences. Initially, sequences for new device set up of a Samsung
Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7Plus will be included. Other sequences may be added later
on.
REQ-1.5: The sequencer shall have an operator interface to configure, select
jobs, start/stop operation, and provide status and error information to the
operator.
REQ-1.6: The sequencer shall be able to run continuously for at least
20 hours each day.
REQ-1.7: The sequencer shall be as compact as possible. The device fixture and
mechanism should be able to fit on a 2'x3' workbench alongside existing work
area. The controller components may be housed in a separate enclosure.
REQ-1.8: The sequencer shall not leave the work station after installation.

2. System/Device/Unit Constraint requirements:
REQ-2.1:  The sequencer shall be configurable to handle a variety of OEMs and Models.
Initially, only the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7Plus will be supported. Other
device models may be added later on.
REQ-2.2:  The sequencer shall only need to support handheld smartphones.
Tablets are not required to be processed.
REQ-2.3: The sequencer shall cost around $5000 in parts to manufacture.
REQ-2.4: The sequencer shall be housed in a safe enclosure in order to protect
the user from a mechanical/electrical hazard.

3. Other Needs:
REQ-3.1: The sequencer shall not interact directly with a workstation,
but may display information on a webpage.
REQ-3.2: The sequencer shall have labels on any buttons on the sequencer.

4. Optional Features:
REQ-4.1: The sequencer may be capable of voice interaction with the device.
REQ-4.2: The sequencer may have a web interface or built-in interface
which allows for uploading instructions / downloading statistics.
REQ-4.3: The sequencer may include an emergency stop button
REQ-4.4: The sequencer may require a fixture to hold the device
REQ-4.5: The sequencer shall have a configuration mode that will allow
the setup and calibration of a new make, model, or function sequence.

Laying out these detailed project requirements, we were able to generate over
40+ individual prototype sketches; we used these sketches as inspiration when
choosing a final design. The sketches we generated look similar to the ones below:

... our prototype began to emerge organically from the designs we generated; we began
physical construction (selecting a style similar to the second of the above sketches),
first with a cardboard mock-up and second with a static, aluminium chassis. It
is the aluminium chassis which we used as the chassis to construct our first-
and second-semester deliverable products.

Over time, we naturally separated ourselves into our distinct roles without much
designation; luckily we each seemed to find a niche becoming of our skillsets. I
became the team-lead, responsible for goal-setting, management, and
accountability; additionally and since I had the most Linux programming
experience I gradually became the lead programmer for the actual sequencer;
consequently I had to quickly train myself in computer vision and motor
controller programming in order to realize our prototype.

Specifications like the ones above were distributed to the team and helped to
keep us focused and on-track to achieve the final product. Below is the
aluminium chassis which was completed during 484:

My Role and Design Choices
--------------------------

As lead-programmer, I was responsible for programming the computer-vision and
all GPIOs coming from the microcontroller (e.g. stepper-motor control lines,
servo-motor control lines) we settled on, the Raspberry Pi 3b+. I decided to write all of
this in [Golang](https://golang.org/), a relatively new programming language
designed at Google which features exceptional error-handling capability and a
diverse ecosystem of already-written libraries and routines.

I decided furthermore that the motors and camera should be controllable by a simple
command-line tool called `mds-do` (MDS is short-hand for Mobile Device
Sequencer). This CLI tool should, then, hook in to a library which I also would
write. The functionality is entirely implemented in this library; the CLI tool
is only an interface to call the functions exposed in the library.

For computer vision I settled on using OpenCV's template matching to identify
which areas of the mobile device's screen needed to be touched by the stylus
arm. The library then would identify the relative distance from this area to the
stylus arm and move the device over the appropriate distance, lowering the
stylus arm to activate the device's capacitive touch screen and then raising it
once the device had been touched. Because the stepper motors employed on either
axis parallel to the phone were accurate to 1.8deg I had no trouble precisely
touching the exact area of the screen.

The MDS parameters (motor speed, GPIO pinout, motor precision, etc. etc.) are
controlled by a `.toml` file; this makes the MDS easily configurable and
tuneable. The `.toml` example configuration file looks like this:

[[!syntax type="toml" text="""

The sequences in [Sequences/Directory] are CSV files which define the finite
state machines powering each sequence for a given device; each line is a step,
and the (successful) completion of each step warrants the attempt of the next
step in the sequence.

Unfortunately I am not at liberty to share the Golang code nor any code from the
project by contract; however I am permitted to share the details of its
operation (as above) and to give insight into my design choices (also as above).

Design Day and Results
----------------------

At the Senior Design Day this past Friday (2019, Dec. 6) I was unanimously
nominated MVP of my team for my role as team-lead and programmer; although we
didn't win any prizes for our performance I am extremely proud of our execution
and results, achieving nearly all of our core requirements and even some of our
stretch goals.  I feel that my capacity to manage a small group, especially in
an environment where we are expected to rapidly prototype and spec a product,
has greatly improved since having this experience.
