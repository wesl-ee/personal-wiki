I found a can of Phocus at the Dollar Tree near me. The can is a slightly
reflective, dulled silver, and looks very clean. It says "Orange" on the side.
The can is quite sturdy and cracking the top was satisfying, the metal seemed
thicker than other cans.

This drink is not impressive at all. Without reading the label I did not expect
this to be so tame. It's just seltzer water with a very distant echo of orange
flavor. The carbonation is very light, as aggressive as a flat club soda.

The overall experience is redolent of a La Croix. It also happens to have 75mg
of caffeine.
