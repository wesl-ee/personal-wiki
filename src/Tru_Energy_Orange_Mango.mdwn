[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Tru Energy Orange Mango"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

This is one of seveal Tru Energy drinks from Tru, who also make health and
nootropic "focus" drinks like [[Tru_Focus_Apple_Kiwi]], the only difference with
those being they contain l-theanine. Tru is not widely distributed where I am,
but you can order them directly from their
[store](https://drinktru.com/collections/store) online.

This Tru is light and bubbly. The carbonation makes the drink feel velvety
inside my mouth. It's a pleasant texture. As for taste, it's fittingly bright
and dry and partway between a peach and dried mango. A bit sour too. Very easy
to drink and quite good. I'm surprised I have not seen this drink around more
often. They compete in the same niche as Celsius so maybe this makes sense.
