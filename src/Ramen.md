As it has been said, rāmen is a world unto itself. There are so many different
types, textures of noodles, which also vary in thickness and length.
Additionally there are many different types of broth, which may or may not have
seasoning, a hint of wasabi, green onions, or any other ingredients you can
imagine.

I am only a student in this brave new world. However, I know enough to grasp the
beauty of the kaedama system. The scenario is simple: you finish your noodles
but you're still hungry. Rather than drinking the broth and calling it quits,
you shout 「Kaedama!」 and all of sudden you have another full serving of
noodles at a fraction of the price of the meal. For instance, a regular order of
tsukemen (つけ麺) costs me 750円. A kaedama only costs me 110円 on top of that.
You can even order a hankeadama (半かえだま) at some places, which is just a
half-serving of noodles.

Interestingly most westerners consider rāmen a noodle dish whereas in Japan it's
always considered a soup with noodles in it. Maybe that's because what's in the
broth is often the tastiest.

There's no "right" way to eat the dish, but most
agree the tastiest is to use the spoon to collect some broth and to dip the
noodles into this broth, bringing both closer to you so you are not slurping
noodles from such a great distance. To eat this dish with confidence is to slurp
any noodles you grab with chopsticks all in one go. Nobody cares how noisy you
are. Slurping like this also cools down the noodles so you don't burn your
tongue if the broth is still scalding hot.
