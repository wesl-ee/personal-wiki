Many organizations wanting to proactively defend against phishing employ
periodic audits against their members to increase awareness about the content of
phishing emails and to increase report rates of legitimate phishing attempts to
the proper channels. These campaigns involve sending “test” phishing emails to
users' inboxes and expecting them to both not click on the links inside and,
hopefully, to report them to the IT resources dedicated to tracking phishing.

If you are looking to keep a clean and tidy 100% report rate and to have the
best kill rate for test phishing emails on your team then look no further than
the email headers sent along with these tests.

| Vendor            | Header                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| KnowBe4           | X-Phishtest                        |
| Proofpoint Wombat | X-ThreatSim-ID, X-ThreatSim-Header |
| Cofense           | X-PhishMe                          |
| PhishMe           | X-PhishMeTracking                  |

The presence of these headers helps whatever service is sending these test
phishing emails to recognize when one that is reported is part of a planned
phishing test, and is not a legitimate phishing attempt. Outlook rules filtering
on these headers can help you sort these emails into an appropriate folder to be
reported at your convenience. Technology!
