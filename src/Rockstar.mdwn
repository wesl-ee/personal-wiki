[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Rockstar"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Ah, Rockstar. Previously its own entity, Rockstar was purchased by Pepsi Co for
$3.85 billion in 2020. I was made aware of this energy drink through its brief
inclusion in the movie _Crank_, a timeless cinematic masterpiece and gem of its
time.

Rockstar sat at a 3rd place in the US with an 11.8% market share in 2007 [^1]
behind Monster (2nd) and Red Bull (1st). It's since fallen very far down in
market share and I don't know anyone who seeks out Rockstar in particular.

The taste is tart and crisp. Extremely smooth to drink. The first time I had one
I thought the taste was so tart that it bordered on caustic; maybe my palette
has developed but I grew to love this dimension of Rockstar and no longer feel
that it is overbearing.

The finish is like biting into a peach. The fine bubbles give the drink a silky
texture as if it were nitrogenated. It is a thoughtful, beautifully composed
drink.

I didn't notice this before but the full-sugar Rockstar, where other drinks use
high-fructose corn syrup, specifies that it uses glucose syrup. Like how all
squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares, high-fructose corn
syrup is a glucose syrup but not all glucose syrup is the high-fructose corn
type. With Rockstar my mouth is not as sticky as when I drink something like
[[Rip_It_Dragon_Fire]] which suggests they derive this syrup from a plant other
than corn.
