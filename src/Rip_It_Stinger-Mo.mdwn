[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review — Rip It Stinger-Mo"]]

Just like some other Rip It flavors like [[Tribute
C.Y.P.-X|Rip_It_Tribute_C.Y.P.-X]] and [[F Bomb|Rip_It_F_Bomb]], the name of
_Singer-er Mo_ betrays nothing of what this drink should taste like. The can has
no suggestion of the taste at all. The website simply says "pure energy tropical
fruit... an exotic blend of tropical fruit and botanicals with the full energy
component that “stings” typical energy drinks."

It's a [[Monster]] clone. And it's a damn good one. One of my favorite Rip It
flavors simply because it reminds me of a better energy drink. A little more
sour than the OG Monster but damn good, actually. I am surprised.
