Fastest Kid in 5th Grade was a metalcore band from Greensboro, North Carolina.
Their only release is [Just Whales
(2009)](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/fastest-kid-in-5th-grade/just-whales/).
They were active for 3 years, from 06 to 09. I learned about these guys when I
bothered a friend for bands similar to Between the Buried and Me, another North
Carolina-based band. Their one album is great.
