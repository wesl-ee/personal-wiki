[[!tag Car]]

The 318ti was equipped from the factory with two different types of engines:
on the early 318ti (1994 〜 1996) this was the M42 engine; on the later
318ti (1996 〜 2000) the M44 engine succeeded the M42. Both engines are
inline-4; all M44 engines leverage a dual-length intake manifold (DISA, short
for DIfferenzierte SaugAnlage) while only some late M42 engines do. DISA
increases the length of the intake at higher RPM. More systems which do this are
called "variable intakes."

I have heard the [[M44_Engine]] runs best on 93 octane but truthfully this is
the only gas I have ever pumped into the car so take that as untested fact.
