[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Fusion Paradise Pulse"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

I got this one along with [[Fusion_Rockin_Rainbow]] at the local Speedway, a brand
which was acquired by 7-11 in 2021. Prior to being a Speedway this location was
a Hess. A long lineage of corporate acquisitions and mergers are reflected in
the history of this humble gas station.

Fusion is a product of 7-11[^1] as suggested by the words "7 Select" in small
text beside the brand name.

The taste is clean, refreshing and artificial in a good way. Artificial
sweeteners like Ace K do not imbue the drinks with a stickiness like
high-fructose corn syrup does, giving this drink its clean texture. It's 86F
today and drinking this outside is not revolting like some other drinks are in
the heat. As for the flavor, this drink is like a sour blueberry.

Overall it's surprising how pleasant this drink is considering also how cheap
it's sold for: $2.49, which is a price point I only expect from the world's
worst [[Rip Its|Rip_It_Tribute_Cherry_Lime]]. With zero sugar and 200mg caffeine
that ain't bad!
