[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” NOS GT Grape"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Completing the NOS trinity (excluding [[NOS_Zero_Sugar]]), I have today NOS GT
Grape. The other two flavors available are [[NOS_Sonic_Sour]] and the original
[[NOS]]. Both NOS and [[Full_Throttle]] were sold to Monster in 2015. Why are
they still around? Who knows. I still love both. There were [many more
flavors](https://www.energydrinkmania.net/en/nos/) of NOS but these are the only
four I've found recently in the US. I remember seeing TURBO around 2020, but
they've discontinued it already.

Compared to the original flavor, GT Grape is much less aggressive. Out of all
the NOS I've tried, GT Grape is the smoothest and easiest to drink. The
artificial grape taste is strong and has a light blueberry aftertaste. Its
profile is most similar to Grape Fanta, but it's carbonated and has 160mg of
caffeine.
