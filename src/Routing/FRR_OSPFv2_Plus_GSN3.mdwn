Last October I gave a presentation to the Linux User Group @ N.C. State titled
["Emulating LAN/WAN Technologies from the Comfort of your Own Home with
GNS-3"](https://lug.ncsu.edu/presentations/2020-10-20-network-emulation.pdf).
In that presentation I explored several methods for simulating complex virtual networks
on a single host. The approach I spent the most time on in that presentation
involved FRR Docker containers networked via GNS3. I've found this approach to
be quite lightweight and intuitive and I use this approach myself for learning
new networking concepts and validating my understanding of the underlying
software.

This article demonstrates the complete setup of an emulated two-tier network
inside GNS3. Connectivity at the distribution layer is provided by
containerized instances of [FRR](https://frrouting.org/) running OSPFv2. Later
a Cumulus VX is introduced to the topology which provides the same functionality
but using a full network operating system. A basic knowledge of networking is
assumed but certain concepts are explored in depth so that this write-up may be
used as a learning resource as well as a reference for building other topolgies
using the same tools.

Below is the topology we'll ultimately construct. It sports one backbone OSPFv2
area made from 3 FRR Docker containers and one Cumulus Linux VX allowing
east-west traffic between two Alpine tenants. Area 0 is organized in a ring to
demonstrate how link failures can affect routing around this topology.

Why use FRRouting / Docker / GNS3?
----------------------------------

The stack I use here may be surprising to some and absolutely heretical to
others. After all, many may associate GNS3 only with IOS and Cisco hardware.
GNS3 however supports many backends like QEMU VMs, Virtualbox VMs, VPCS and (of
immediate interest) Docker containers. My reasons for choosing this stack over
other possible simulation methods others are:

1. GNS3, Docker, QEMU and FRR are all free software
2. FRR supports many routing protocols so many common networks can be modeled
3. Containerization makes each router lightweight so one can spin up more
   routers with less overhead than running many FRR instances in full VMs

And most importantly for me, my work often involves messing with one or another
FRR daemon so this is useful for debugging and testing my patches to FRR itself
🙂

Before we get started, I'll give a a small disclaimer that this all *probably*
works on a Windows or Mac machine but I've never tested it; I only develop from
my Gentoo Linux machine but both Docker and GNS3 have Windows installers so try
it if you're feeling adventurous.

Getting Started
---------------

The first step is to install the tools that the rest of this write-up will use.
The install steps will vary depending on the operating system but the necessary
tools are:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) ≥ 2.2.0
- ... and optionally [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/) for VX support

Docker provides the platform for running several FRR containers while GNS3 will
connect these containers together in an arbitrary topology and provides a nice
GUI to interface with. In version 2.2.0 GNS3 added support for persistent
storage via Docker and this ability is leveraged here to install persistent FRR
configurations on each of the routers.

Pull the Docker image for FRR from its [dockerhub
page](https://hub.docker.com/r/frrouting/frr) to begin. We host both a `latest`
tag and versioned tags which correspond to older releases. Either of these can
be pulled as below:

[[!syntax type="bash" text="""
# Pull the latest FRR from Dockerhub
docker pull frrouting/frr:latest
# Pull a specific version of FRR from Dockerhub
docker pull frrouting/frr:v7.5.1
"""]]

Pulling a specific version of FRR instead of the `latest` tag is recommended.
It's worth also noting that versioned tags such as `v7.5.1` often offer builds
for a wider variety of architectures. Keep this in mind if running GNS3 + Docker
on an ARM platform.

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~ $ docker images frrouting/frr
REPOSITORY          TAG         IMAGE ID            CREATED        SIZE

### A Note on Building Your own FRR Image

Images published to FRR's Dockerhub are built from scripts available in [FRR's
source repository](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/tree/master/docker/alpine);
the script uses a series of Alpine containers to build a final image also based
on Alpine. Containers can be built directly on the host machine instead of pulling from
Dockerhub by running a build script available in our repository:

[[!syntax type="bash" text="""
git clone 'https://github.com/FRRouting/frr.git'
cd frr
# Checkout tags, edit files etc.
./docker/alpine/build.sh
"""]]

This approach is helpful when adding new features or testing fixes to
FRR itself as it will build directly from the current working branch.

If setting up a network that emulates clients or tenants it may be useful to
import some other images such as `alpine` to use as edge devices.

[[!syntax type="bash" text="""
# Pull an Alpine Linux container that we'll use as an edge device
docker pull alpine
"""]]


Working with Docker Images in GNS3
----------------------------------

Next these containers will be imported to GNS3 to use later.  With the GNS3 GUI
open go to "Edit" → "Preferences" → "Docker containers". Then create a new
container template for the FRR image that was just built or pulled.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreid7wsrguuaj4m2z36nc4sfagtsxrnqdnw3sh7lsng2buvgih6inpe" size=medium]]
<figcaption>Docker container configuration in GNS3</figcaption>
</figure>

After clicking through the "new container" dialog the new FRR
container will be visible in the list of available devices in the left-hand
pane. Next it's important to find and right-click the device in that pane, hit
"Configure Template" and go to the "Advanced" tab.

Enter `/etc/frr` under the "Additional directories to make persistent".
This could also be done with the image's VOLUMES config directly in Docker but
it's easier to do here in my opinion. `/etc/frr` is the default directory FRR
stores its configuration files. The two important files here are `frr.conf` and
`daemons`.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreia63qo2kkqrzemq6rkikwnewpcrdvu32xqo5wmdmg3daviaragguu" size=medium]]
<figcaption>Configuration of the persistent storage</figcaption>
</figure>

Now each FRR container brought into the GNS3 workspace will have its own
persistent configuration directory. This is important for configuring the
routers that will define the network as each router now gets its own
configuration file.  It's also helpful to set an icon for the container to
differentiate it from other devices. I happen to know where to find [an FRR SVG
file](https://frrouting.org/img/frrouting.svg) which can be imported into GNS3
(＾∇＾).

This persistent storage is allocated per-node and is located in the GNS3 project
folder. For example, if there were 3 of these FRR nodes in a project workspace
then there would be three directories under
`$PROJECT_NAME/project-files/docker`:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~ $ ls -l code/gns3/untitled/project-files/docker/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 w w 17 May 26 13:25 a604d518-9fd9-454c-adf1-1be593d8944a
drwxr-xr-x 3 w w 17 May 24 22:01 de5e2cb9-daf4-4a63-909f-a0d0f51fe227
drwxr-xr-x 3 w w 17 May 24 22:01 e12f6df6-1c43-4151-886b-fb2381cf436e
"""]]

The names GNS3 gives to Docker image instances seem to be arbitrary; this makes
it difficult to know which configuration file is in which directory. To remedy
this I often create symlinks that correspond to the names of the routers in my
topology:

[[!syntax text="""
ln -s a604d518-9fd9-454c-adf1-1be593d8944a r1
"""]]

There are a few ways to find which node-id corresponds to which router in the
topology. The easiest is to add nodes one at a time and then symlink them as they
are added to the workspace. This is the method I use as it's brutally simple and
easy to fill out as the topology is created.

Another method, especially useful if labeling a topology that's already
constructed, is to simply right-click on a router in the workspace and either
click "Show node information" or "Show in file manager". Both will show the
"Router ID" which will help locate to the folder.

Working with a Single Node
--------------------------

Before networking containers together let's get comfortable working with just a
single node.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreib4evjits2eck6ofe56fnjr4mwnknusnwed7x2edua3tqwx4lwoeu" size=medium]]
<figcaption>Single-node setup</figcaption>
</figure>

Drag an FRR node from the left pane onto a blank workspace. Right-click the node
and select "Start". This will immediately boot the container and from this point
on the container can be interacted with as a normal Docker container from any
terminal:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~ $ docker ps --format '{{.ID}}: {{.Image}}'
d55364e9df0a: frrouting/frr:v7.5.1
w@kvm-gentoo ~ $ docker exec -it d55364e9df0a vtysh
Hello, this is FRRouting (version 7.5.1_git).
Copyright 1996-2005 Kunihiro Ishiguro, et al.

FRR-7.5.1-1#
"""]]

`vtysh` is the program used to interact with FRR's many daemons,
[`ospfd`](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/ospfd.html) and
[`zebra`](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/zebra.html) among them. The above
workflow is the most convenient way to spawn this shell on a router provisioned
by GNS3 + Docker.

Instead of `vtysh` one *could* spawn `/bin/bash` and edit `/etc/frr/frr.conf`
directly on the router but it will be easier once we have the whole topology to
edit these files from the host's filesystem. To find where the `/etc/frr/`
directory is on the host, right-click the node and choose "Show in file
manager". I'd recommend calling this node `r1` and creating a symlink resolving
the node's ID to a friendlier name in that persistent directory as I
demonstrated above.

Running OSPFv2 on a two-node topology
-------------------------------------

Good news: configuring an OSPFv2 router with FRR is easy! There's really only
two steps:

1. Change `ospfd=no` to `ospfd=yes` in `/etc/frr/daemons`
2. Configure OSPFv2 parameters in `/etc/frr/frr.conf`

Of course planning out the topology beforehand is important too but GNS3's
drawing and notation tools can help with this step. Nodes can be connected
together using the "Link" option in the left-hand panel; just select which
interfaces terminate either side of the link when connecting two nodes.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreiaduomrtbqpp6vl33sqd5pz25wjhnks6or4yomzuktlgv6yrgv3cy" size=medium]]
<figcaption>A two-node setup in GNS3</figcaption>
</figure>

The `frr.conf` of each router is quite simple. Once the `daemons` file has been
edited to have `ospfd=yes` instead of `ospfd=no` then add the following files to
the persistent storage:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~/.../project-files/docker $ cat r1/etc/frr/frr.conf
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.100/31
"""]]

... and for `r2` it's nearly the same thing:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~/.../project-files/docker $ cat r2/etc/frr/frr.conf 
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.101/31
"""]]

It is also possible to configure a static IP through `/etc/network/interfaces`
but since this is partly an FRR tutorial I've configured it through the suite
itself.

Starting FRR and Packet Tracing
-------------------------------

If both routers were now started from the GNS3 "Start/Resume" button
something like this could be seen from a `vtysh` instance spawned via `docker
exec`:

[[!syntax text="""
r1# show ip ospf database

       OSPF Router with ID (10.0.0.100)

                Router Link States (Area 0.0.0.0)

Link ID         ADV Router      Age  Seq#       CkSum  Link count
10.0.0.100      10.0.0.101        20 0x80000005 0xa83b 1
10.0.0.101      10.0.0.101        20 0x80000004 0x9831 1

                Net Link States (Area 0.0.0.0)

10.0.0.101      10.0.0.101        21 0x80000001 0x4fc3
"""]]

If this or something similar appears then
[congratulations](https://youtu.be/wDajqW561KM)! Both routers are peering via
OSPFv2. If the peering does not happen (or if there is an "unknown command"
error) just ensure OSPFv2 is enabled in the `daemons` file and that both routers
are part of the same `area 0.0.0.0`.

One of the extremely cool things about GNS3 is that one can watch packets on the
wire between `r1` and `r2` flow in real-time. Right-clicking the link will
prompt to open Wireshark and will immediately show packet dumps on this cable.
Flapping the `eth0` interface on `r2` will show an exchange of routing
information in the Wireshark trace.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreifwerqv4dx4nfoyryp3dy5vjefjjguz2lshvk3wsyr3gtuaanvofe" size=medium]]
<figcaption>Example exchange of routing information in OSPFv2</figcaption>
</figure>

This is insanely cool! Especially considering that my workflow for something
like this before GNS3 had been to `tcpdump` on a VX and then pull the pcap
*back* to my computer and load it into Wireshark just to view it... the ability
to watch the trace in real-time is very helpful in deepening my understanding of
(among many things) the exchange of LSAs in arbitrary topologies. This is not
limited to just OSPF but this protocol is what I've played with most often in
this sandbox.

Expanding into a Ring Topology
------------------------------

Because two routers is never enough let's add two more! I will connect these
four in a ring topology instead of a full-mesh.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreid3vozilayiyggkuzhdqpxle37gff5tipjfcljk3jp3j3dafcuqhu" size=medium]]
<figcaption>A 4-node Ring Topology</figcaption>
</figure>

If the SPF algorithm were not running nodes which were not directly connected
would have no route to each-other. Running OSPFv2 here allows traffic to be
routed around this topology easily, and the ring topology (as opposed to a chain
topology) avoids introducing a single point of failure as we'll see when we blow
up a link later on.

Here is the `frr.conf` for `r1`:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~/.../project-files/docker $ cat r1/etc/frr/frr.conf 
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.100/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth1
	ip address 10.0.0.107/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
"""]]

... `r2`:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~/.../project-files/docker $ cat r2/etc/frr/frr.conf 
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.101/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth1
	ip address 10.0.0.102/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
"""]]

... `r3`:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~/.../project-files/docker $ cat r3/etc/frr/frr.conf 
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.103/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth1
	ip address 10.0.0.104/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
"""]]

... and `r4`:

[[!syntax text="""
w@kvm-gentoo ~/.../project-files/docker $ cat r4/etc/frr/frr.conf 
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.105/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth1
	ip address 10.0.0.106/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
"""]]

One further difference between this topology and the previous 2-node setup is
the inclusion of `ip ospf network point-to-point` which suppresses the election
of a Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR). With only two
nodes on any ethernet segment in this configuration there is no point in
electing a DR since a DR only serves to minimize the number of flooded LSAs on a
segment with many OSPF routers.

One can verify that adjacent nodes have formed the expected neighbor
relationships via `vtysh`:

[[!syntax text="""
r1# show ip ospf neighbor 

Neighbor ID     Pri State           Dead Time Address         Interface       RXmtL RqstL DBsmL
10.0.0.102        1 Full/DROther      37.972s 10.0.0.101      eth0:10.0.0.100     0     0     0
10.0.0.106        1 Full/DROther      38.523s 10.0.0.106      eth1:10.0.0.107     0     0     0
"""]]

If the `point-to-point` directive were omitted some nodes would be elected as
DRs and BDRs for the configured segments. Instead in this case all neighbors
are labeled `DROther` indicating they are neither DRs nor BDRs.

Adding Clients to the Access Layer
----------------------------------

The ring topology created above represents a *distribution* layer; in a
datacenter the switches at this layer are typically called top-of-rack (TOR)
switches (though they are more often full-mesh and not in a ring topology) and
they provide network *access* to the tenants in their rack. Right now this
topology has no tenants.

Let's add two tenants here, `tenant1` and `tenant2`, to two separate racks. In
order for the routers in the backbone to know where to route packets destined
for either tenant the external subnets must be *redistributed* into the network
by their bordering routers, known as AS boundary routers or ASBRs.

I use one of GNS3's built-in unmanaged L2 switches from the "Browse Switches"
tab on the left to connect tenants logically to the network, though this is
mostly unnecessary and tenants could simply be directly connected to the
switches running FRR. The introduction of the unmanaged switch only demonstrates
that the subnet may be configured arbitrarily without affecting east-west
traffic.

<figure>
[[!template id="hooya-img.tmpl" cid="bafkreifd2a4r3rrkwqbrh22ozr757it2ountdrovgrqrm6edcplswb7kcu" size=medium]]
<figcaption>End-devices in the access layer are connected together by the distribution layer</figcaption>
</figure>

For tenants I've used simple Alpine images pulled from [the Alpine
Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Unlike the FRR container's IPs
which were configured in `frr.conf` the container IP for Alpine is configured
through GNS3 by right-clicking the Alpine node in the workspace and selecting
"Edit config", which allows quick editing of the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

For `tenant1` this config looks like:

[[!syntax text="""
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.1.1
"""]]

... and for `tenant2` I've simply got:

[[!syntax text="""
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.2.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.2.1
"""]]

Since two networks will be attached to the current one the `frr.conf` files of
the bordering routers must be tweaked some. For instance, the router will need
to be informed to not run OSPF on this interface, and it must also know to
redistribute this interface into the backbone area.

On the `r2` ASBR I've adjusted the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file to look like:

[[!syntax text="""
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
	redistribute connected
	passive-interface eth2
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.101/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth1
	ip address 10.0.0.102/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth2
	ip address 192.168.1.1/24
"""]]

... and the `r3` ASBR looks like:

[[!syntax text="""
router ospf
	network 10.0.0.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
	redistribute connected
	passive-interface eth2
interface eth0
	ip address 10.0.0.103/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth1
	ip address 10.0.0.104/31
	ip ospf network point-to-point
interface eth2
	ip address 192.168.2.1/24
"""]]

Notice that on the "access layer" (that is, where the tenants are connected) the
default route is set to the address of the ASBR for that subnet. Traffic is then
routed around the "distribution layer" (where all the FRR switches are) as
appropriate. One could connect this topology to the Internet via a default route
through one (or several) of the FRR switches but I will forego this in the
interest of *not* modeling the Internet (｀・ω・´)”.

With some GNS3 magic you can even [connect this topology to the *actual*
Internet...](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/using-gns3/advanced/connect-gns3-internet/)

### Traceroute and Link Flapping

Let's make sure the topology works as expected. Though I often use `docker exec`
to spawn an additional shell on the Alpine tenants it's just as easy to
right-click the node and select "Console" which will open a telnet session to
the node. Just remember to `^]` instead of `^D` or `exit` otherwise you will
kill the main process and the tenant will shut off!

[[!syntax text="""
/ # hostname
tenant1
/ # traceroute 192.168.2.100
traceroute to 192.168.2.100 (192.168.2.100), 30 hops max, 46 byte packets
 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  0.618 ms  0.439 ms  0.289 ms
 2  10.0.0.103 (10.0.0.103)  0.541 ms  0.806 ms  0.624 ms
 3  192.168.2.100 (192.168.2.100)  1.118 ms  1.127 ms  0.852 ms
/ #
"""]]

Whoah, that's going all the way to the other tenant! Pretty neat. Now that
east-west traffic is flowing let's try to break it by turning off an interface
along that path. Specifically, I'll `shut` the `eth0` interface on `r3`.

[[!syntax text="""
/ # hostname
r3
/ # ip link set eth0 down
"""]]

With that interface offline the changes should propagate to the link-state
database as soon as the dead timer on `r2` expires. At that point `r2` emits a
Hello packet and upon not receiving a reply from `10.0.0.103` will emit an LSA
containing this update to its only neighbor, who in-turn relays that to their
other neighbor and so on.

Once this information has flooded the area try another traceroute.  Remember
that the prior shortest path between `tenant1` and `tenant2` was effectively
severed in the middle.

[[!syntax text="""
/ # hostname
tenant1
/ # traceroute 192.168.2.100
traceroute to 192.168.2.100 (192.168.2.100), 30 hops max, 46 byte packets
 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  0.364 ms  0.385 ms  0.291 ms
 2  10.0.0.100 (10.0.0.100)  0.477 ms  0.763 ms  0.604 ms
 3  10.0.0.106 (10.0.0.106)  0.831 ms  0.859 ms  0.790 ms
 4  10.0.0.104 (10.0.0.104)  0.922 ms  1.263 ms  1.117 ms
 5  192.168.2.100 (192.168.2.100)  1.373 ms  1.558 ms  1.443 ms
"""]]

Even though that interface was axed traffic still went around the ring, using
five hops this time instead of three; notice that the path is through `r1` and
`r4` instead of `r2` to `r3`. Kick-ass!

Throwing Cumulus VX into the Mix
--------------------------------

In case things were not complicated (read: cool) enough we'll now substitute one
of the FRR containers for a [Cumulus Linux
VX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/cumulus-linux/)
running in QEMU. This emulation can also be accomplished with Virtualbox if you
like that better or don't have QEMU installed.

Head over to [the Cumulus VX download
page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/cumulus-vx/)
and snag a `.qcow2` image (for free!). Once the image is downloaded it can be
imported into GNS3 under "Edit → Preferences → Qemu VMs" (or "VirtualBox VMs").
From here find and select the downloaded `.qcow2`. Many of the default
parameters for VMs in GNS3 are fine but I've found that the following greatly
improved my CL VX performance. Tune these values to your own machine as not
everyone has 32GiB of RAM for VM reasons (｀・ω・´)”:

1. Increase maximum allowed RAM from 256Mib → 2GiB
2. Increase vCPU allocation from 1 → 2 cores
3. Increase the number of network adapters from 1 to 4

It may be wise to choose `vnc` as the console instead of `telnet`. Some CL
images send things to console and others only output to the connected display.
For the networking, advanced adapter settings are available under the "Network"
tab of the "Configure" window though I haven't found much use for them yet.

I also suggest picking a cool icon for your VX!

Since Cumulus Linux uses FRR as its routing suite it's straightforward to
replace the old FRR container `r1` in the example topology with a CL VX since
the config is the exact same. Since this is a VM and not an FRR Docker container
the switch has all the expected Cumulus-isms as well as a full arsenal of Debian
utilities.

It's important to know that CL VX will label the first interface as `eth0` and
the remaining will be labeled as `swpX` interfaces. Don't ask me why but just
add one more interface than is needed and start connecting links around the
topology starting from the *second* interface (`e1`).

As far as I can tell GNS3 clones the original CL image for each node dropped
into the workspace so multiple CL VX can be introduced without interfering with
each-other. This *also* means that configuration made to the VM disappears once
the node is deleted from the workspace which can be a Good or a Bad Thing.

Adding many VMs introduces overhead to the host computer, and though GNS3
can be ran remotely it is likely that a developer's typical system may become
overloaded if running too many VX in VMs. For that reason I recommend FRR Docker
containers where possible and VX only where needed, though there are some
high-traffic cases where even the containers may overheat. This is especially
true for GNS3 and other simulation tools since there is no physical ASIC to
off-load the normal data-plane operations to.

Anyhow this is the final topology!

Special Considerations / Limits
-------------------------------

In any environment where devices must be highly available such as the datacenter
it may be useful to tune the protocol timers to be more aggressive. FRR has the
`frr defaults datacenter` directive which "reflects a single administrative
domain with intradomain links using aggressive timers" that does just that.

However when timer adjustment is not enough protocols like BFD can be leveraged
to provide extremely quick reaction to link-down events. Incidentally FRR has a
daemon `bfdd` which provides BFD support for many of its daemons (ˆڡˆ)v. I'm
unsure of `bfdd` performance in a strictly virtual environment like GNS3 but
because GNS3 does not emulate an ASIC this likely causes lots of CPU overhead
and timing jitter which is not acceptable for testing the extreme lower limits
of BFD timers.

Of course, one could relax the timing window for BFD but if one is debugging
timing issues... there are ways to connect physical switches to GNS3 (via the
"Cloud" object in the left-hand pane) but I don't own a physical switch so it's
hard to test that capability.

Conclusion
----------

GNS3 can do some seriously cool stuff! Given its popularity as a platform for
training with Cisco IOS images it's understandable that people may not have
played with the more hidden bits of GNS3. As explored in this write-up it can
also network together Docker containers and even connect together NOS VX images
like Cumulus VX.

Recently this has become my preferred way to quickly network boxes together,
particularly FRR containers. It's not hard to imagine a topology with many FRR
containers and a single "device-under-test" VM where FRR or some other suite
could be quickly built and installed. Some tests could then be executed (or even
*orchestrated*?) and network coherence could be quickly established by
inspection of the DUT VM and surrounding containers. Or maybe this could all be
connected out to a physical lab full of switching hardware or maybe it could be
connected to many other GNS3 environments or maybe, or maybe...

In any case this is an approach I've found extremely useful for NOS development
and I hope writing it all down helps someone down the line!
