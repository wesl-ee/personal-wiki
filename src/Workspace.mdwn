My workspace is where I sit to type stuff when I'm at home. In my current
workspace I built the desk myself but I was so excited to finally have a
meaningfully large desk that I didn't set aside time to stain it.

I have a [fuller gallery](https://gallery.wesl.ee/gallery/Workspace) with
pictures of the places I have worked over the years which I maintain on a
separate site.

I lived in an apartment in Cary, North Carolina before I moved into the home I
am in now. This was my workspace in that apartment:
