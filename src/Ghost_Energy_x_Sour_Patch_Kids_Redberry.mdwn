I love Ghost. Right now, second to [[Red_Bull]], they are my favorite brand
doing it. Consistently they churn out amazing flavors, all with zero sugar,
which is nice. Red Bull fills a different niche for me as their zero-sugar
flavors are fine but their full-sugar offerings are amazing. I only enjoy them
when I am aiming to eat at a caloric surplus. I can enjoy Ghost anytime without
compromising my [[fitness goals|Physical_Fitness]].

This Sour Patch Kids flavor, in contrast with the [[other one they
have|Ghost_Energy_x_Sour_Patch_Kids_Blue_Raspberry]], tastes closer to the waxy
flavor of Swedish Fish than to the taste of Sour Patch Kids. Of course it has a
healthy dose citric acid as with all other Ghosts. Maybe it's that I've never
had Sour Patch Kids without the Sour part; maybe that's what they actually do
taste like. I'm not sure. Ghost has a Swedish Fish flavor too which I have not
reviewed on this site yet, this one may have significant overlap with that
taste.
