[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Vitaminwater Energy Tropical Citrus"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Vitaminwater is one of those brands I typically ignore, along with all other
"health" branded drinks, because I normally get my [daily
dose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of vitamins and minerals from
my diet.

But this isn't just normal Vitaminwater though. And it's not really an energy
drink either, but it _does_ have 60mg of caffeine and has _energy_ in the title.
This flavor, Energy Tropical Citrus has been on shelves since at least 2002[^1].
Some sources I've seen list the caffeine content at 50mg but the bottle I have
in my hands says 60mg. They probably adjusted it some time between release and
now. Not that a difference of 10mg is perceptible, but it does push the drink to
being equivalent to about half a 12oz [[Red_Bull]].

This drink is very easy to drink and very inoffensive. Tastes like water with a distant echo
of orange citrus. Somewhat bitter. If this marketed as an energy drink, I'd be
upset, because it's none of the things energy drinks are, even the
non-carbonated ones. But, as a drink that happens to have caffeine, it's
pleasant, cheap, and does have some sugar but not too much.
