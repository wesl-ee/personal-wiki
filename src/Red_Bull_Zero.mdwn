[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Red Bull Zero"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Evidently the Red Bull Zero I have in my hands here is a pretty new phenomenon.
Having released on Jan 6 of this year, 2025, it replaced the old Red Bull Zero
in the gray can. The purpose of both the new and old Zero variants, [[like any
zero-sugar variant|Zero_Sugar_,Versus_Sugar_Free]], is to closely approximate
the taste of the original without any of the sugar. To that end, this new Red
Bull Zero uses monk fruit extract, which I had not heard of until I tried this
one. This year's [[zero-sugar Winter
Edition|Red_Bull_Winter_Edition_Iced_Vanilla_Berry_]] uses acesulfame potassium
as a sweetener instead of monk fruit; both use sucralose.

The taste is exceptionally sweet on the first sip, then it evaporates into a
completely vapid flavor devoid of any discernible taste but its sweetener blend.
It's exceptionally artificial and scarcely reminds of of Red Bull at all. The
sour apple taste of the OG it tries to imitate is just not there. Even
sugar-free Red Bull is more enjoyable to me and is more redolent of [[the
king|Red_Bull]].
