[[!meta title="Instant Noodles Review — Nongshim Shin Spicy Cup Noodles"]]
[[!tag Instant_Noodles Review]]

Shin “Gourmet Spicy” comes in either a cup or a bag. I like the cup form factor
more as it lets me pour boiling water over it and cook it right there without a
microwave. Technically this “ramyun” not rāmen but who cares. It is a reliable
favorite of mine as it's widely distributed in the US. I pick one up sometimes
from my local Food Lion but this one I nabbed at HMart.

In the cup is spice powder in a foil pouch. There are dried vegetables like
carrots, green onions and small slices of mushroom already sprinkled in the cup.

The noodles are thin but have a good bite to them, especially if you do not cook
for more than 3 minutes. Even before drinking the broth I know this is spicy as
the noodles soak up some of the broth well and translate the heat to my tongue.
My nose is running a bit from the spice but it's pleasant. I like the rehydrated
green onions and other vegetables; they break up the monotony of noodles that
cups without these dehydrated vegetables have. The noodles are very easy to
slurp up and eat quickly if you wanted to.

The broth is very tasty and expectedly spicy. There are strong notes of garlic
and beef. Again, my nose is still running a bit from the heat.

All in all it's a very good cup noodle.
