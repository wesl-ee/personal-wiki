Hi, I'm Wesley, also known as **wesl-ee**.

I work at Nasdaq in concert with the [Digital
Assets](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/digital-assets) team here to build a
platform for custodians to manage, deposit and withdraw [[Digital_Money]] on
distributed ledgers.

Previously I developed a perpetual futures exchange based on a
[[vAMM model|The_Problem_With_vAMM_Perpetuals]] with
[Levana](https://levana.finance) on the [[Terra]] blockchain shortly before the
collapse of Terra's native UST stablecoin.

Before this I worked as a Software Engineer in NVIDIA's [Networking Business
Unit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/) (NBU). I graduated from
[[North_Carolina_State_University]] with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and
another B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I also accidentally took enough courses
during my college tenure to collect my minor in mathematics on the way out the
door.

Tech
----

I am a digital native; I believe [[Digital_Money]] is the future. I run an
[[On-Prem_Home_Lab_Kubernetes]] cluster which hosts this website and many other
services. I am building a generally available P2P network called
[[HooYa!|HooYa]] which already hosts all of the images on this website.

New software I write these days is typically in Rust but I have a strong
background in Go and C++. The technologies I use beyond these languages are too
many to mention. My personal code is available from [my
Github](https://github.com/wesl-ee).

Personal
--------

Within and without the above tech I maintain my hobbies.

My daily-driver is a [['97 BMW 318ti|BMW_318ti]] which I maintain to its factory
specification. This car is older than me yet somehow still runs; I am its only
mechanic.

I am fluent in [[Japanese]]; I studied at [[Sophia_University]] in Tōkyō, Japan;
continuing my Japanese study is one of several outlets for me to express my
passion for learning.

My [[aesthetics|Discover/Aesthetics]] are important to me; I am in the gym and
lifting more days than I am not.

Other things I love:

- [[Drawing]]
- DJ'ing as [[DJR3]]
- Playing games made for [[Virtual_Reality]]
- Making + enjoying [[Coffee]]
- Cooking, both for myself and with my fiancé

Most of the day I exist in my [[Workspace]].
