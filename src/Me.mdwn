Hi, I'm Wesley, also known as **wesl-ee**. I program [[Digital_Money]]. I work
at Nasdaq in concert with the [Digital
Assets](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/digital-assets) team here to build a
platform for custodians to manage, deposit and withdraw assets on distributed
ledgers.

Previously I developed a perpetual futures exchange based on a
[[vAMM model|The_Problem_With_vAMM_Perpetuals]] with
[Levana](https://levana.finance) on the [[Terra]] blockchain shortly before the
collapse of Terra's native UST stablecoin.

Before this I worked as a Software Engineer in NVIDIA's [Networking Business
Unit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/) (NBU). I graduated from
[[North_Carolina_State_University]] with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and
another B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I also accidentally took enough courses
during my college tenure to collect my minor in mathematics on the way out the
door.

Tech
----

I am a digital native. I believe [[Digital_Money]] is the future. I run an
[[On-Prem_Home_Lab_Kubernetes]] cluster which hosts this website and many other
services. I am building a generally available P2P network called
[[HooYa!|HooYa]]. I command technology because technology is a tool to build our
vision in general, and my vision in particular.

Personal
--------

Within and without the above tech I maintain my hobbies.

My daily-driver is a [['97 BMW 318ti|BMW_318ti]] which I maintain to factory
specification. This car is older than me yet somehow still runs. I am its only
mechanic.

I am intermediately fluent in [[Japanese]]; I studied at [[Sophia_University]]
in Tōkyō, Japan; continuing my Japanese study is one of several outlets for me
to express my passion for learning.

My taste in music is… different. I express this taste under my pseudonym
[[DJR3]] from time-to-time, playing IRL + online DJ sets.

Other things I love:

- Playing games made for [[Virtual_Reality]]
- I drink and make [[Coffee]]
- Cooking, both for myself and with my fiancé

Most of the day I am hanging out in my [[Workspace]].
