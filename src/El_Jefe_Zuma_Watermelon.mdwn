[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Almost no infromation about this energy drink exists online. I saw it in a
vending machine in a few distinct monorail stations in Las Vegas but have never
seen it anywhere else (yet). I discovered online that the trademark application
for the art on the front of the can was entered on Sep 18 2024 and granted to El
Jefe Global LLC while the trademark for their company logo was entered April of
this year, both through a CA-based attorney. This is very new. It was $5 because
it was in a vending machine in the station. I went back and forth on whether to
buy it. Eventually I did, clearly.

It has an amazing taste and texture. 10 / 10 on every metric. Taking a sip right
after it's opened, the texture is soft and fluffy and as ephemeral as cotton
candy. The taste is immacualte: green apple candy, not sour at all, amazingly
refreshing. The name I feel is a misnomer because it's not close to cucumber at
all. That is this drink's only fault. In the Nevada heat it's the most
refreshing and effective energy drink one could conceive.
