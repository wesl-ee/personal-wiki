This **personal wiki** is a place to dump [[my|Me]] personal knowledge and
ideas. I use this as a space to blog and to aggregate the information I know. It
is always changing. I often revise old entries when presented with new
information.

The wiki trend is quite old. The first wiki was the [[!c2 WikiWikiWeb]]. Many
have iterated on this concept since. Personal wikis are derived from this wiki
format but the pages of a personal wiki are created and edited by only the
author of the wiki. Sometimes, but not necessarily, pages embrace the author's
bias and present a personal view of the world. This contrasts with pages in a
traditional wiki which seek to define a knowledge domain in more neutral terms,
or at least in terms which align with the wiki's community. For more about the
wiki idea and its contrast with the monolithic Wikipedia see [[!c2
WikipediaIsNotWiki]].

The most well-known of personal wikis is [Everything Shii
Knows](https://shii.bibanon.org/shii.org/knows/Everything_Shii_Knows.html). You
probably only care about this wiki if you care about imageboard history for
Shii's perspective on
[4chan](https://shii.bibanon.org/shii.org/knows/4chan.html) as a 4chan
moderator.

Some personal wikis I like are on my [blogroll](/Blogroll/#personalwiki).
