[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review — Rip It F Bomb"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

There are two words that come to mind when someone mentions the [[!wikipedia
F_Word]]. But Rip It “F Bomb” introduces us a third F word: “fruit”. This is
evident from the explosion of pineapples, blueberries and cherries under the
drink's name. Otherwise I'd have a hard time pinning what they meant with this
name.

It's barely carbonated and tastes of the same artificial fruit flavor they use
in red Kool-Aid. There is a vague taste of oranges on the front. The sticky
feeling around my mouth lingers after every sip, as is always the case with Rip
Its. The liquid is comically red.

But at $1.49 in today's economy, it's not all that bad.
