The Food Lion near me is well-stocked with Maruchan Fire Bowl Spicy Beef Ramen.

It is the best, most reliable noodle bowl I can get when I go to the grocery
store nowadays. Sure there is [[Maruchan_Gold_Spicy_Miso]] there but those
aren't in a bowl. I love the bowl. To me it's an inseparable part of the
experience so I get these with some frequency.

They're not that great. The noodles are very thin, kind of pathetic. They do
absorb the broth well, though, so I can already taste the spicy broth as I eat.
There are a _lot_ of noodles (440 calories) so it takes me a bit to finish.
There are dried vegetables here but they don't add much, so whatever, not
important.

The broth is spicy. I love spicy things and to me it's still notably spicy.
There is not much depth to the flavor, just the taste of dried cayenne pepper.
Supposedly the broth should taste like beef; it's hard to make out beyond the
heat. It's very spicy. I'm sniffling some after finishing.
