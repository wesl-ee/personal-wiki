You're reading my homepage & personal wiki; nothing is off-topic here! The big
blue links [[like this one|Me]] will lead you further down the rabbit-hole of
this site so click as many of those as you can to learn more! Approach pages on
this site as if they are Wikipedia articles, and click relevant large blue links
to read the related article.

I am the only one with write-access so all opinions are my own and all
information here can only be as correct as I am; this site is generated with
love and [[!iki ikiwiki]] and collects much of my writing, ranging from
full-length write-ups to thoughts I have throughout the day. It is my personal
knowledge base and also the manifestation of my character on the
[Wired](https://sel.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wired).

I still haven't filled out many of the pages on this site but if you'd like to
start exploring my personal wiki some the best way is to read a little about
[[Me]] because that's who's writing this!

[[!linkmap pages="(Me

or Japanese
or Sophia_University

Here are some of the topics I write about here. Larger text means I've written
more about that topic.
