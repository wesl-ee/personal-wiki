You're reading my homepage & personal wiki; nothing is off-topic here! I'm the
only one with write-access so all opinions are my own and all information here
can only be as correct as I am; this site is generated with love and [[!iki
ikiwiki]] and collects much of my writing, ranging from full-length write-ups to
thoughts I have throughout the day. It is my personal knowledge base and also
the manifestation of my character on the
[Wired](https://sel.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wired).

I still haven't filled out many of the pages on this site but if you'd like to
start exploring my personal wiki some the best way is to read a little about
[[Me]] because that's who's writing this!
