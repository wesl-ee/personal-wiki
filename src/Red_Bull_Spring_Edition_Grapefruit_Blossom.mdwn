[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

The introduction of a Spring Edition Red Bull is a first for the US market, and
which has happened over 12 years after Red Bull "Editions" were introduced in
late 2012[^1] with the
[Red](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2012/12/red-bull-red-edition-energy-drink-review.html),
[Silver](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2012/11/red-bull-silver-edition-energy-drink.html)
and
[Blue](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2012/12/red-bull-blue-edition-energy-drink.html)
edition. These 3 tasted like cranberry, lime and blueberry respectively.
Seasonal editions were introduced not long after with the Summer 2014[^2] can,
later enshrined as the Yellow Edition in 2015 and made permanent. Through the
years, some seasonal flavors have become permanent and some have replaced
existing Editions after their brief tenure as the seasonal flavor because of
dwindling sales or whatever for one flavor or another.

The 2025 Spring Edition _Grapefruit & Blossom_ released on March 3, 2025[^3] and
almost immediately I found it on the shelf of my local Speedway (formerly Hess)
and the day after at this local Exxon I like. Their distribution chain is
insane, I guess that's what those Red Bull distribution trucks are for. Since
2009 Red Bull has been largely distributed by a deditated distribution company
creatively called Red Bull Distribution Company (RBDC) which was responsible for
more than 50% of US domestic Red Bull distribution in 2021. The more you know!

Japan got a 2025 Spring Edition simply called Strawberry and the kind soul at

Anyhow, back to _Grapefruit & Blossom_.

The taste is of fruitier rose water. It is a bright, crisp, clear taste redolent
of the Spring for which it's named. On the finish, a bold note of grapefruit or
orange juice resonates clearly. It's amazing and almost like candy; very easy to
drink. The can's description of _Graprefruit & Blossom_ is surprisingly accurate
to the drink's taste. Red Bull consistently amazes me with its depth and
complexity; compared to many others, Red Bull makes other companies' efforts to
create a fruity and bright profile for the medium feel half-assed at most.

Compared to this past season's [[2024 Winter Edition Iced Vanilla
Berry|Red_Bull_Winter_Edition_Iced_Vanilla_Berry]] this one bats just below for
me in terms of personal favorites. But it's not bad. Very good actually. Very
very good.
