One more HMart find, a carbonated energy drink from Suntory. Definitely a
[[Red_Bull]] competitor and maybe an edgier Dekavita C.

Deeper taste than [[Red_Bull]] and lacking the metallic note. Carbonation gives
it a sharp first note, but after carbonation has died this is a much smoother
drink. Notes of a sour pear; citric acid is heard clearly through the taste.
