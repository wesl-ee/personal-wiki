[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” 28 Black Classic"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

I was very weirded out by this energy drink when I was given it. The can design
makes it look like an off-brand label or something from the older generation of
energy drinks, like Burn or the old Full Throttle colorway. It seems to have
international availability as even [Energy
Drink-kun](https://www.energydrinkmania.net/en/28black/) has written about it
being distributed in Japan. Evidently, here, this can came from an [[Exxon]].
God Bless.

The phrase "Classic Energy Taste" emblazoned across the front immediately made
me think this would taste like the original [[Monster]]. But it tastes like
[[Red_Bull]]. But, on reflection, of course it tastes like Red Bull. It's a
European energy drink company after all.

The taste is wet, unlike Red Bull itself which is dry. Both taste like battery
acid. 28 Black nailed that aspect. Carbonation is mild and lacks that metallic
taste I get from Red Bull. Also unlike Red Bull, 28 Black lacks taurine.

Because of the taurine thing they push 28 Black as "cleaner" energy. In my book
it's not very "clean" if it still has 28g of added sugar!
