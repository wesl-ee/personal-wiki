For whatever reason Google Chrome does not allow one to disable browsing
history. When I type things into the searchbar (omnibox, in Chrome's vocabulary)
I don't get value from the suggestions that pop up which are not bookmarked
sites; such suggestions are just noise to me.

Most online help suggests to launch Chrome with the `-incognito` flag, but I
know we can do better. Plus, incognito mode comes with a host of other features
like wiping all cookies on exit that I don't want to use all of the time.

In the absence of a toggle for disabling history in browser settings the only
remaining option is the nuclear one, which is to revoke write access from the
history file after deleting your history. This way Chrome cannot track your
profile's history because it cannot write to the file in which it records this
history. This file is called `History` and is inside your profile's directory
within Chrome's data directory. Here's a quick list of steps to achieve this:

1. Delete all browsing history from Chrome first
2. Open `chrome://version` and note the profile path
3. Run `chmod a-w "{PROFILE_PATH}/History"` in a shell instance
4. Close and re-open Chrome

This will revoke write access from everyone on that SQLite file; for me this
approach takes the place of a history autodelete plugin I used to use; I feel
this approach is much more appropriate. Recently closed tabs will still be
suggested but this doesn't bother me as much.
