[[!meta title="Instant Noodles — Tapatío Chili Lime Shrimp (Bowl)"]]
[[!tag Instant_Noodles Review]]

My impression on seeing the bowl is that there must be a lot of noodles in it
because it is so big. In reality it's a normal amount of noodles, similar in
quantity to [[Maruchan_Fire_Bowl_Spicy_Beef_Ramen]] despite being in a 30%
larger container; the rest of the bowl is just empty space. Fooled me! Still,
there are a good amount of noodles here (500cal) just not as many as I was led
to believe by the size of this thing.

On opening the plastic I see that the lid is made of some weird embossed
plastic. It's a nice texture. I run my finger over it a few times. I've never
seen a cup noodle with this kind of lid. If it were on more luxurious noodles
it would elevate the experience of the whole cup. Here, because it's Tapatío, it
feels out of place.

Overwhelmingly salty and tastes like the powdered lime flavor they put in
_Tajin_. Much lime taste. Plenty to go around. On the aftertaste there is an
echo of shrimp, which is good because normally the shrimp taste in cup noodles
is quite bad. This one's fine. Carrots and green onion don't add much but
texture.

The broth is like zesty, tangy tomato soup and tastes closer to oranges than to
limes. Again, like with [[the other Tapatío I've had|Tapatio_Original_Cup]],
I'll remark that zesty broth makes me upset. It's not normal. Very unexpected.
And not good.

Otherwise, the broth is sorta spicy, as the pepper on the lid warned me.
