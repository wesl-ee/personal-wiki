HooYa! is a Web3 community for commissioning and supporting manga & dōjin
artists; it offers leasable storage space for illustrations submitted by artists
and network users and provides a
[folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) of descriptive,
searchable tags and metadata for each illustration it hosts. HooYa! maintains
also a folksonomy for images that are not stored on-chain but that may be
accessible through other services such as Pixiv and Danbooru.

It aspires to be rapidly become completely autonomous and self-governing by
issuing its own governance tokens for use in image proposal / acceptance and
metadata tagging. It also seeks to incentivize the on-chain commission + minting
of new artworks by [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) &
[dōjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujinshi) artists (hereafter
"illustrators") via these native utility tokens.

### Background

The service HooYa! provides is not novel; it finds inspiration from a handful of
Web2 companies (mainly Japanese ones) and from the communities that form around these
companies and the illustrators they support. I see HooYa! as a combination of
these two communities in particular:

- [Pixiv](https://pixiv.net), a Japanese-language community of illustrators who
  connect with fans by posting original and derivative artworks
- [Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rating%3Ageneral+&z=5), a
  community dedicated to the archive of illustrations like those posted on
  pixiv, known mostly for its extensive vocabulary of tags used for organizing
  and labelling these images

The wealth of information provided by Danbooru has helped many [unique
projects](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2021#applications) to create
machine-learning models that can both (a) predict appropriate tags for a given
illustration ([example](https://autotagger.donmai.us/),
[src](https://github.com/danbooru/autotagger)) and (b) generate new
illustrations that resemble the Japanese style
([example](https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/),
[background](https://www.gwern.net/TWDNE)).

HooYa! will leverage these pioneering predictive models to suggest tags on
images submitted for inclusion on the network.

### What is Pixiv?

[Pixiv](https://pixiv.net) is a community of primarily Japanese illustrators who
upload their illustrations, comics and short stories and share them with other
pixiv members. This is one of the primary ways that illustrators can connect
with their communities and make their artwork accessible to their fans. It is
the [10th](https://www.similarweb.com/website/pixiv.net/#overview) most visited
site in Japan and is most popular among young Japanese illustrators and their
fans.

Pixiv offers a Patreon-like subscription program called
[pixivFANBOX](https://www.fanbox.cc/) which connect fans with illustrators
publishing derivative and original illustrations on a regular basis by providing
fans in each subscriber tier with special goods, articles and hi-res renders of
illustrations released by the artist.

Because drawing is a popular hobby in Japan (and one which is gaining popularity
abroad) the idea of earning a living as an illustrator has attracted many creators,
both Japanese and internationals, to the Pixiv platform.

</figure>

In addition to subscription services pixiv also provides a space for
illustrators to sell their illustrations, manga (both short- and long-form) and
artbooks on its [BOOTH](https://booth.pm/en/browse/Comics) site. These can be
digital-only releases but there are also physicals for sale which are produced
through its pixivFACTORY service.

Fans can commission personal works from illustrators by a feature on
pixiv known as
[Requests](https://www.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/900002679206-Request-flow).
Requests can be funded entirely by an individual or can be crowd-funded by many
fans pooling cash together to commission the piece.

Finally, Pixiv lets fans and illustrators to add a limited set of tags to an image
(up to 10) to an image. These Pixiv tags are more akin to hashtags on Twitter
than semantic metadata as seen on sites like Danbooru.

### Danbooru

[Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rating%3Ageneral+&z=5) is a
community that tags and archives images from Pixiv, Twitter, DeviantArt and many
other platforms. Each image submitted for inclusion on Danbooru goes through a
3-day review period after which it is either accepted or denied inclusion into
the Danbooru canon. Danbooru maintains a large
[vocabulary of tags](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help:tags) which
are key-value pairs used to describe an image. This makes the set of images
easily searchable by specifying (eg) the illustrator, character, franchise or
any objects in an image.

</figure>

As shown above Danbooru lets me search things such as: illustrations of the Love
Live! franchise which include product placement of some kind, by issuing the
query <code>love&lowbar;live! product&lowbar;placement</code>. From left to
right, top to bottom these are the [Subaru
WRX](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=subaru_wrx+rating%3Ageneral),
[Starbucks](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=starbucks+rating%3Ageneral),
[Coca-Cola](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=coca-cola+rating%3Ageneral),
[Sprite](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=sprite_%28drink%29+rating%3Ageneral)
and the [Yamaha
Vino](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=yamaha_vino+rating%3Ageneral).
Danbooru limits searches to 2 tags unless the user has purchased a
[Gold](https://danbooru.donmai.us/upgrade) account, in which case the limit is
raised to 6. Gold accounts cost a one-time purchase of $20 USD.

Danbooru hosts over **4.9 million images** tagged with **162 million tags**, of
498k unique tags as of the end of 2021. A single copy of this data consumes 4.5
terrabytes of disk space.

As alluded to earlier, this massive data set has allowed researchers to create
predictive models leveraging neural networks to label the objects in a brand
new illustration, thus reducing the workload on a single user tagging an image.
In addition to predictive models, generative adversarial networks (in particular
NVIDIA's StyleGAN) have been trained with the Danbooru set to draw brand new
illustrations when prompted with a series of tags.

To the left is <a
href="https://www.gwern.net/Faces#portrait-results">Gwern's</a> Danbooru2018
portrait model trained to generate portraits in the Danbooru style (credit <a
href="https://www.gwern.net/Faces#portrait-results">Gwern</a> for the model and
video). Each image in the interpolation is unique in that it is an original
of the GAN, and though the model was seeded from the images collected on
Danbooru the portraits are original creations.

HooYa! uses the predictive model and the generative model in a few different
ways (see below *3: Prediction* and *4: Generation*).

HooYa! — A Decentralized Platform for [Dōjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujinshi) & Manga Artists
--------------

Now with some understanding of the context in which HooYa! is being developed I
can explain the mechanics the HooYa! network.

HooYa! at its core can be broken into three components:

1. Consensus (of metadata, tags, governance, and the image canon)
2. Leased ephemeral storage (of commissioned images and those minted on-chain)
3. Prediction (of tags) + generation (of reference images)

The first two of these four components may be familiar to some; the last one is
a novel component to compute on a blockchain and is one thing (among many) which
I hope will set HooYa! apart from many other chains, both on Cosmos and beyond.

### 1 — Consensus

HooYa! is a blockchain built on the **Cosmos SDK**. It uses Tendermint (like
nearly every other Cosmos SDK chain) to maintain network connectivity and
consensus across a group of validators. Many chains I have seen begin with a
set of 100 validator slots and so this is what HooYa! adopts initially.

Each node has a perfect copy of *the canon* which refers to the set of:

- Images (uniquely identified by a SHA2-256 <a
   href="https://github.com/multiformats/multihash">multihash</a>)
- Ownership of those images
- Tags describing those images
- Metadata describing those images

... that HooYa! indexes. HooYa!'s canon is a subset of network state and
therefore any archival node can retrieve a full copy of the canon at any given
chain height. On-chain governance, ongoing subscriptions to illustrators,
payment settlement for commissioned artwork is a subset of HooYa! network state,
and therefore is a part of data stored on the blockchain, but is not what I mean
when I reference *the canon*, which refers to exclusively those four things
above.

*The canon* is contributed by HooYa! network users, not necessarily the original
illustrators themselves. HooYa! users may consult the neural networks proposed
in (3) during the image tagging process to more accurately and swiftly tag
images. Furthermore because *canon* includes only metadata about an image but
not the image itself there is no risk of infringement on any copyrights by
storing *canon*; the image data is stored in ephemeral storage (2) if it has
been leased; this data is released once its lease expires.

### 2 — Leased Ephemeral Storage

In addition to running the HooYa! daemon which maintains consensus (1) all
validators are expected to run an [[IPFS]] daemon. This daemon
connects validators to each other in a private cluster separate from the
"global" IPFS instance that we often refer to when talking of IPFS. The private
IPFS cluster provides ephemeral storage of the images that HooYa! has reached
consensus in (1) should be stored on the network a period of time determined by
the image's lease terms.

Unlike for metadata stored as a part of consensus (1) no guarantee is made
regarding the retrieval of data whose lease has expired. Validators are not
required to store copies of all data ever indexed by HooYa!, only data whose
lease is current because that space is reclaimed once the lease for that space
expires.

To my knowledge no other Cosmos SDK chain (not even <a
href="https://stargaze.zone">Stargaze</a> which arguably should use this)
leverages IPFS like this. I believe this is a wonderful decentralized
alternative to things like <a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/">Pinata</a> for
IPFS pinning that is especially attractive for NFT projects on Cosmos. *Even if
other projects do not use HooYa!'s consensus (1) or neural-net prediction +
generation (3) they can lease ephemeral storage (2) to store NFT metadata and
images.*

### 3 — Prediction + Generation

There are a number of pre-trained models which can predict tags for a given
illustration. Validators host these neural networks and provide suggestions for
each image uploaded to ephemeral storage in (2). The deterministic nature of
these networks dictates that each image has exactly one set of network outputs
(ie predicted tags); models are therefore versioned and distributed as part of
network upgrades, ensuring each validator has the latest neural network, and
those that do not provide bitwise identifical network outputs will see their
stake <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/slashing/">slashed</a>
after an amount of time. This behavior is similar to the slashing on Gravity
Brdige ( see <a
href="https://github.com/cosmos/gravity-bridge/blob/main/spec/slashing-spec.md">GRAVSLASH-02
</a>)

For providing one-time GPU compute power for tag prediction validators are
compensated with a portion of the data leasing fee.
