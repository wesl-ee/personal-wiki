[[!meta title="HooYa! Network"]]

HooYa! is an IPFS-like network for sharing and downloading files tagged with
rich semantic metadata. Network participants provide a
[folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) of descriptive,
searchable tags and metadata for the set of all files across the network. For
those familiar with image boorus, consider it a P2P booru.

In the spirit of _dogfooding_, I use HooYa! to organize my own media even as I
build it. For example, I run a private HooYa! network on my [[home Kubernetes
cluster|On-Prem_Home_Lab_Kubernetes]] providing all images and videos on this
site, including the media on this very page (hooyaception). All code is
developed under an open source license and [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/hooya-network).

At [public-demo.hooya.wesl.ee](https://public-demo.hooya.wesl.ee) there is a
demo of the full stack. That instance stores pictures and videos I've taken in
Tōkyō from when I [[studied there in 2018|Sophia_University]] and [[visited
there in 2023|Tokyo_23]], both times of which I've written about on this site
before. Some video and screenshots of the UI are below.

HooYa! aspires to become completely autonomous and self-governing by issuing its own
governance tokens for use in image proposal / acceptance and metadata tagging.
It also seeks to incentivize the on-chain commission + minting of new artworks
by [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) &
[dōjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujinshi) artists (hereafter
"illustrators") via these governance tokens.

However before I tackle the implementation of network governance, I am focused on
building the P2P overlay network for file-sharing and making this a pleasant
software to use and host that can be used to organize personal file storage and
exchange semantically rich metadata.

### Background

The service HooYa! will provide is not novel; it finds inspiration from a handful of
Web2 companies (mainly Japanese ones) and from the communities that form around these
companies and the illustrators they support. I see HooYa! as a combination of
these two communities in particular:

- [Pixiv](https://pixiv.net), a Japanese-language community of illustrators who
  connect with fans by posting original and derivative artworks
- [Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rating%3Ageneral+&z=5), a
  community dedicated to the archive of illustrations like those posted on
  pixiv, known mostly for its extensive vocabulary of tags used for organizing
  and labelling these images

The wealth of information provided by Danbooru has helped many [unique
projects](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2021#applications) to create
machine-learning models that can both (a) predict appropriate tags for a given
illustration ([example](https://autotagger.donmai.us/),
[src](https://github.com/danbooru/autotagger)) and (b) generate new
illustrations that resemble the Japanese style
([example](https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/),
[background](https://www.gwern.net/TWDNE)).

</figure>

HooYa! will leverage these pioneering predictive models to suggest tags on
images submitted for inclusion on the network.

### What is Pixiv?

[Pixiv](https://pixiv.net) is a community of primarily Japanese illustrators who
upload their illustrations, comics and short stories and share them with other
pixiv members. This is one of the primary ways that illustrators can connect
with their communities and make their artwork accessible to their fans. It is
the [10th](https://www.similarweb.com/website/pixiv.net/#overview) most visited
site in Japan and is most popular among young Japanese illustrators and their
fans.

Pixiv offers a Patreon-like subscription program called
[pixivFANBOX](https://www.fanbox.cc/) which connect fans with illustrators
publishing derivative and original illustrations on a regular basis by providing
fans in each subscriber tier with special goods, articles and hi-res renders of
illustrations released by the artist.

Because drawing is a popular hobby in Japan (and one which is gaining popularity
abroad) the idea of earning a living as an illustrator has attracted many creators,
both Japanese and internationals, to the Pixiv platform.

page</a></figcaption>
</figure>

In addition to subscription services pixiv also provides a space for
illustrators to sell their illustrations, manga (both short- and long-form) and
artbooks on its [BOOTH](https://booth.pm/en/browse/Comics) site. These can be
digital-only releases but there are also physicals for sale which are produced
through its pixivFACTORY service.

Fans can commission personal works from illustrators by a feature on
pixiv known as
[Requests](https://www.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/900002679206-Request-flow).
Requests can be funded entirely by an individual or can be crowd-funded by many
fans pooling cash together to commission the piece.

Finally, Pixiv lets fans and illustrators to add a limited set of tags to an image
(up to 10) to an image. These Pixiv tags are more akin to hashtags on Twitter
than semantic metadata as seen on sites like Danbooru.

### Danbooru

[Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rating%3Ageneral+&z=5) is a
community that tags and archives images from Pixiv, Twitter, DeviantArt and many
other platforms. Each image submitted for inclusion on Danbooru goes through a
3-day review period after which it is either accepted or denied inclusion into
the Danbooru canon. Danbooru maintains a large
[vocabulary of tags](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help:tags) which
are key-value pairs used to describe an image. This makes the set of images
easily searchable by specifying (eg) the illustrator, character, franchise or
any objects in an image.

</figure>

As shown above Danbooru lets me search things such as: illustrations of the Love
Live! franchise which include product placement of some kind, by issuing the
query <code>love&lowbar;live! product&lowbar;placement</code>. From left to
right, top to bottom these are the [Subaru
WRX](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=subaru_wrx+rating%3Ageneral),
[Starbucks](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=starbucks+rating%3Ageneral),
[Coca-Cola](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=coca-cola+rating%3Ageneral),
[Sprite](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=sprite_%28drink%29+rating%3Ageneral)
and the [Yamaha
Vino](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=yamaha_vino+rating%3Ageneral).
Danbooru limits searches to 2 tags unless the user has purchased a
[Gold](https://danbooru.donmai.us/upgrade) account, in which case the limit is
raised to 6. Gold accounts cost a one-time purchase of $20 USD.

Danbooru hosts over **4.9 million images** tagged with **162 million tags**, of
498k unique tags as of the end of 2021. A single copy of this data consumes 4.5
terrabytes of disk space.

### What is HooYa! to Pixiv and Danbooru?

HooYa! is built from first principles to be P2P software. This differentiates it
from Danbooru, which is centralized, and Hydrus, which is not P2P.

The addition of token governance allows HooYa! to compete in the niche that
Pixiv and other commission platforms fill now with the Japanese and Otaku
market, by facilitating artwork commissions. A convenient consequence of being a
P2P file-sharing network with on-chain governance is that art comissioned on
the blockchain that supplies the governance layer could be stored trivially on
the overlay network.
