[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Black Rifle Energy Wild Frost"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Our eyes prompt us as to how things may taste. Things in blue cans taste blue.
Things in red cans taste red. And things in white cans taste like... who knows.
White is always a toss-up. I try to put aside visual bias when observing the can
because it _does_ affect how I think of the taste. Visual design, colorways and
little details like these are just more tools in the manufacturer's arsenal to
push you in the way they want you to think. If you lost sight, you'd be free of
this bias, at the tragic consequence of many other inconveniences.

That's all to say the can is white. Black Rifle also makes a [[Ranger
Berry|Black_Rifle_Energy_Ranger_Berry]] with a blue colorway; it tastes how
you'd expect.

Here, Wild Frost doesn't taste like much at all, like club soda with 200mg of
caffeine and a vague, distant echo of a raspberry. It's not bitter. It's not
sweet. It's not really anything at all. If it _were_ just caffeine and club
soda, which I've had, it would taste bitter, but the fact it does not is a
testament to the weight that sucralose pulls in masking, or at least distracting
from, the bitterness of caffeine.

The carbonation is light and velvety on the tongue. This is the most tame, most
boring energy drink I've had. Its unexceptional nature reminds me of how boring
and unexceptional one of the first energy drinks I reviewed here,
[[Phocus|Phocus_Review]], was. It may be remarkable because of just how
unremarkable it is. This is a class of energy drinks I'll affectionately call
[rounded Spongebobs](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Not_Normal).

Anyhow, on a hot day this would be refreshing. As an energy drink it's
underwhelming with respect to flavor. The upside is that it has no sugar and
little citric acid.
