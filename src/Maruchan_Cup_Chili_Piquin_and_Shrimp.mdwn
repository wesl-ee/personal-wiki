[[!meta title="Instant Noodles Review â€” Maruchan Instant Lunch Chili Piquin and Shrimp"]]
[[!tag Instant_Noodles Review]]

Random pull from a convenience store. It says "CAJUN style" on the front but
cajun cooking normally uses cayenne pepper for heat, not typically piquin. Maybe
it's because of the shrimp? In any case I had already dedicated 5 seconds of
thought to this cup already so I picked it up. The Maruchan Instant Lunch
noodles are always very cheap. They are helpful to eat as I bulk because they're
free calories. And I get to write about it.

The noodles are so bland. They soak up a bit of broth that makes it all a bit
spicy. But the broth does not have much flavor aside from the spice .But not very. About the same amount of spice as
[[Maruchan_Cup_Hot_Spicy_Beef_Flavor]], maybe even lower. The shrimp really
suck. Like with [[Maruchan_Cup_Lime_Chili_Flavor_With_Shrimp|]], the shrimp are
comically small and taste terrible, like dirt.

I should really stop getting any Maruchan with shrimp in it. The kinds without
shrimp, like [[Maruchan_Cup_Beef_Flavor]], have been fine. In Japan, seafood cup
noodles, especially the one from Nissin, are [very
popular](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000023.000135215.html). Maruchan
US people should take note.
