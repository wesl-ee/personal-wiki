[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Bang Cotton Candy"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Bang is my go-to brand when I want a zero-sugar + high-caffeine energy drink,
particularly useful when I'd rather not drink my calories. The flavors are
reliable and there are so, so many of them. Most of them taste like candy.
Unfortunately the drinks [no longer contain Super
Creatine](https://www.foodbev.com/news/monster-secures-311m-victory-over-bang-energy-in-false-advertising-case),
but it's not like Super Creatine had effects similar to creatine in the first
place. Fatal mistake! I talked a bit about Super Creatine also in the first Bang
review on this site, [[Bang_Black_Cherry_Vanilla]].

The taste of Cotton Candy is hollow up front, eventually dissolving into an
empty, vapid approximation of waxy, gummy candy. Last, you taste a light note of
citric acid. It doesn't really taste like cotton candy in particular but the
taste is still very good. It's one of my favorite Bang flavors for that reason.
