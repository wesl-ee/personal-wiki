[[!meta title="Tinned Fish â€” Cento Flat Fillet Anchovies"]]
[[!tag Tinned_Fish Review]]

I assumed when I first thought about them that tinned fish would be cheap.
Unless you're getting canned tuna in water, they're not. Even tuna can be
expensive. But anchovies? These are $3.19 for this little tin. It's a luxury
item. Eating fish out of the can is a symbol of status. If I have to explain it
to you, it's clear that you wouldn't get it.

These are another Food Lion pull.

These anchovies are super salty but actually have a good taste for tinned fish;
they are surprisingly easy to eat on their own. The [[Olive_Oil]] lends a smooth
texture but itself lacks any taste. It's probably pomace oil, which is the most
suitable olive oil for high-heat cooking, which is required for canning. There
are little bones in the filets but they are microscopic because anchovies are
small fish.

Still, in spite of the taste, the filets were so, so salty. I couldn't finish
half the tin without feeling like I was rapidly becoming dehydrated.
