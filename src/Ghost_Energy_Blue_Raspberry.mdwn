Ah, GHOST. I'm not a fan of the unlicensed GHOST releases like Iced Tea
Lemonade, which I've tried but have not (yet) written on. This new Blue
Raspberry will replace [[Ghost_Energy_Sour_Patch_Kids_Blue_Raspberry]] as Ghost
lost the license to produce Nabisco-branded products following the acquisition
of 60% of stake of GHOST by Dr. Pepper Keurig.

Blue Raspberry tastes like the Sour Patch Kids Blue Raspberry GHOST with a bit
less citric acid and with a subtle note of some fruit like an apple. Other than
that, still has the same trademark fantastic blue raspberry taste and, compared
to other non-GHOST drinks, still very sour even in its dampened state.

As with most good zero-sugar drinks this Ghost is sweetened with acesulfame
potassium and sucralose.
