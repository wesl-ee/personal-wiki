Search on the Internet in <current-year> sucks and will only get worse as search
results are overrun with LLM-generated content. If there was any doubt of the
merit of the Dead Internet theory before GPT3 arrived then there's no doubt
about it now (at least, the part about bots).

The value of hunman-produced information on the Internet has gone parabolic and,
with it, I've felt that it is important to enumerate some of the personal
websites of People I know on the Internet and call it my blog roll.
