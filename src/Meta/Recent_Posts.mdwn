Here's a breakdown of all pages on this wiki ordered by time of creation. This
is definitely the least-cool way to browse the site; I find it more fun to just
keep clicking on the blue links and wander around but this is provided to give
less-accessible pages some visibility too.

[[!inline  archive="yes" pages="*
	and !(ikiwiki or ikiwiki/*)
	and !*.*
	and !img
	and !vid
	and !templates
	and !recentchanges
	and !smileys
	and !wikiicons
	and !shortcuts
	and !Discover/*
	and !index"
]]
