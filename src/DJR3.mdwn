I often relax and explore my mood through music. Beginning in late 2019 I began to
DJ'ing exclusively & *anonymously* under the moniker **DJR3**. I use that
identity now as as a pseudonym only when I DJ and when I play music fitting
these these non-exclusive genre tags:

+ Hardstyle, Hardcore
+ Nightcore, Nightstyle, Happy Hardcore
+ Neorave
+ Drum and Bass
+ French House

I've performed more in [[Virtual Reality]] than I have in real-life, though
often my sets are hybrids of VR + IRL. I explore unconventional, real-time
settings, like throwing interactive, VR raves in *Garry's Mod*, a video game
released in 2006. Actually I coded a gamemode for Garry's Mod called [STREAM
STAGE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2067726690)
expressely for this, if only because I was curious if it could be done. It *can*
be done and I have done it many times.

Here are all videos of the sets I have played which I have archived:
