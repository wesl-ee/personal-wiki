I often relax and explore my mood through music. Beginning in late 2019 I began to
DJ'ing exclusively & *anonymously* under the moniker **DJR3**. I use that
identity now as as a pseudonym only when I DJ and when I play music fitting
these these non-exclusive genre tags:

+ Hardstyle, Hardcore
+ Nightcore, Nightstyle, Happy Hardcore
+ Neorave
+ Drum and Bass
+ French House

I've performed more in [[Virtual Reality]] than I have in real-life, though
often my sets are hybrids of VR + IRL. I explore unconventional, real-time
settings, like throwing interactive, VR raves in *Garry's Mod*, a video game
released in 2006. Actually I coded a gamemode for Garry's Mod called [STREAM
STAGE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2067726690)
expressely for this, if only because I was curious if it could be done. It *can*
be done and I have done it many times.

Here are all videos of the sets I have played which I have archived:

I did this set entirely in VR and never took my HMD off for any bit of it. The
game may look like VRChat but it's actually Garry's Mod with VRMod, which gives
this 15+ year-old game VR support. I wrote a gamemode called
[STREAMSTAGE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2067726690)
to accomodate streaming audio to all users in the server so every in the club
experiences the music together.

Unlike my previous Streamstage events, this time I taped a GoPro to my head and
fed the video stream into my HMD. Doing so I was able to coordinate my hand
movements to control the DJ controller on the piano stand in front of me. You
can see the exact feed from the GoPro in the upper right hand corner of the
video screen. The orange-y color is from an OBS filter I applied to it but
that's exactly what I saw in the Quest. It was a little difficult to check my
phone (for instance) but it all worked well in the end.  This creates a fairly
seamless AR / VR DJ experience, assuming you have enough USB ports to do all
this bullshit.

The Mixxx feed (the DJ software I use) also was piped into the headset so I
could select and cue tracks in real time. Any time you see me stare into the
middle-distance or a little above my controller during the set I'm cueing the
next track or checking audio levels. Instead of Quest audio (which can be
nightmarish sometimes) I plugged a pair of headphones into the 3.5mm jack on the
front of my computer and used those as my cues, while my room speakers
(connected to a USB audio interface coming from the PC) played the game audio
which was captured in the final render. This eliminated the latency problems
I've experienced in previous sets, and let me move in-time with what everyone in
the server (and everyone in the stream) saw!

I'm so glad we had a bunch of people log on to the GMod server! I honestly
didn't expect so many friends in game, since this was part of a bigger event
which mostly played out on Twitch.

DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE was a party in VRChat organized by DJ's United and
featuring collaboration with EVA Online to celebrate the release of [R O C K Y's
Euphoria EP](https://soundcloud.com/rockymusic339/sets/euphoria-ep). This was
by far the longest time I'd ever spent consecutively in VR, by the end of it
we'd been talking and dancing and playing music for something like 7 hours. My
trackers died twice and my headset and right controller were nearly dead at the
end but it was an extremely fun night.

I'd like to do VR events / crossovers like this more often. The nice thing about
games like VRChat or Garry's Mod is that you can play them with a headset or
just on keyboard, there were plenty of people that night doing either. Just
having everyone in the same "virtual" room creates such a warm and close
atmosphere despite being maybe thousands of miles away from many of the people
there. There's feeling of closeness, especially in VR where you can see
everyone's body language, that makes experiences like this very special to me.

After three years of operation, the NCSU Imageboard, Howler.space, shut down.
Because we couldn't meet up in-person anymore, as the university was closed for
the rest of the semester, we decided to throw a rave in Garry's Mod. To my
knowledge this hasn't been done before and it required a handful of
[open-source](https://github.com/wesl-ee/gmod-streamstage)
[tools](https://github.com/wesl-ee/gmod-motd) that I wrote to help facilitate
the music and atmosphere of the party. After the music was over we played
Trouble in Terrorist Town on the same server until the website shut down.

4FTERLIFE_ONLINE was an internet neo-rave
community that spawned from inspiration of internet rave life, underground
2000s rave cultures, Y2K, cyberpunk, infornography, identity & existentialism.

livestreamed on 4F_O's twitch channel and featured performances by

Jan 1, 2020 — DECENNIUM 202X: New Year's Eve Event

My setup involved three computers, five instances of `ffmpeg`, one
webcamera, one webserver, and 40GiB of RAM! It's really amazing that all
these things came together to create one continuous experiece; it's this
feeling that's kept me motivated in my experimentation with audio/visual
experiences overall.

It was a super fun night! We started a little later than expected but once
we got started the party went off without a hitch... it was my boyfriend's
(DJ_ABF's) first time DJ'ing and I'm glad he had fun too. The entirety of
the show was streamed on my Twitch channel as well. This show was super special
to me because it was (1) my last show of 2019 and (2) the first show of my last
year of college; I hope everyone at the party and everyone watching the
recording (past, present, future) has as much fun as I did! The audicence was
generally invited from a unviersity imageboard I run but far more people came
out than I expected; especially since this was Winter break I didn't expect so
many people to show up in real-life! Because this event was a blending of
Internet neo-rave culture and my IRL friends I was surprised when we had an
exceptional audience both online and in-person.

The night was divided into **ZONES**, which resemble the Zone Races from
WipEout HD:

**ZONE VENOM** (*DJ_ABF*) (Pop, Big Room, House, Indie)

DJ_ABF opened the night with an accessible amount of pop and indie hits from
the past decade (2010's); unfortunately there is no recording of his set but
his tracklist is published below:

1. Childish Gambino - Retro [ROUGH]
2. Lil Wayne;Swizz Beatz - Uproar
3. Joyner Lucas - I Love (Explicit)
4. New Legends - kFle9pGCtU0
5. Jungle - Heavy, California
6. Two Feet - I Feel Like I'm Drowning
7. Tame Impala - The Less I Know the Better
8. Oceans - 7h3Pd5SbCRI
9. slenderbodies - king
10. James Arthur - You Deserve Better
11. Ed Sheeran feat. Paulo Londra & Dave - Nothing On You
12. The Chainsmokers, Amy Shark - The Reaper
13. LSD - Genius
14. Saint Laurent - WT WJDPfurc
15. Alec Benjamin - Mind Is A Prison
16. Harry Styles - Watermelon sugar

**ZONE PHANTOM** (*BUSHMASTER*) (Big beat, House, Nu-funk, Acid House)

BUSHMASTER played next, generating **ZONE PHANTOM** in the process; his set
consisted of DDR-inspired nu-funk and fighting-game OST hits; it was a
well-mixed and well-balanced set; I especially enjoy BUSHMASTER's taste for
early-2000's esthetic; that much is evident in the visuals (slow-scrolling
text and harsh contrasts) for his set as well as in his music; below is his
(unordered) set list:

1. Concept of Love Intro by Stuff3
2. Michael Gray - The Weekend (Original 12 Inch Mix)

39. Madeon - No Fear No More
40. Stardust - Music Sounds Better With You (12' club mix)

**ZONE ZEN** (*DJR3*) (French House, Synthpop, Future)

I went on next after a short intermission; I split my set in half according
to taste; this first half was focused on upbeat pop and future-sounding
music! My chief inspiration for this half of the set was WipEout HD;
everything I picked out here sounded like it could've been a piece of the
original soundtrack for that game; it is an extremely inspirational game for
me and I think that much is evident in my visuals and my music. Below is my
full set list for **ZONE ZEN**:

1. Cola Splash - Curry Drinker
2. Yuzo Koshiro - Overdrive Neurotransmitters
3. Lolica Tonica - Make me Feel
4. THOMAS BANGALTER & DJ FALCON - CALL ON ME (Muttonheads fine touch remix)
5. Yelle - Moteur action
6. The Touch - Le Night Dominator (Radio Edit)
7. Nightcore  - Rasputin (Remix)
8. M_Ferri - Arturia (Boris Brejcha Remix)
9. Justice - Waters of Nazareth
10. Yelle - Que Veux-Tu (Madeon Remix)
11. Perfume - Spring of Life (Album-mix)

25. Alice DeeJay - Better Off Alone 2008 (C o O k ! e Remix)
26. Yuzo Koshiro - Entry (Maxi2 Version)
27. Virtual Self - Particle Arts

**ZONE SUPERZEN** (*DJR3*) (Neo-rave, Dark Techno)

Next I transition into **ZONE SUPERZEN**; this zone is meant to be the
harsher, neo-rave side of **ZONE ZEN**; the upbeat kick-and-snares of the
former set are replaced with harsh synths and Roland 303 bass lines; I
accompany the change of tone with a visual alteration, swapping out the
bright color palette of the former ZONE with dark blacks and harsh reds
which mirror the music I planned for **ZONE SUPERZEN**; below is the set
list for that ZONE:

28. Serial Experiments Lain - Cables and powerlines and electricity poles compilation
29. Gesaffelstein - Trans
30. 牛尾憲輔 - E
31. Unknown Artist - Untitled (Kalli's Freezing Cold Confused Yoghurt Mix)

41. Creasemaster & Slamdog - Bump The Bass
42. Kenta Nagata - Half Pipe
43. Wan Bushi - Eurodance Vibes Part 5

This may be the most fun I've ever had putting together a show; we had decided
that BUSHMASTER would open and DJR3 would go on right after; this was the second
time I organized / played a set with an opener, the first being Howlerween. I
advertised the party on my website and ~20 people showed overall; I was
super-excited to see everyone!

The entire SUBSYSTEM20XX experience (i.e. both DJ sets) was livestreamed to
Twitch.tv on [my channel there](https://twitch.tv/DJRThree). Despite being my
first time livestreaming an event I think I ran it well; I used two IP cameras
to feed an OBS setup running on a server in my closet; that feed was then
encoded and sent to the Twitch servers to be broadcast in real-time. I hope to
do more streams like this soon.

This was the first set I ever played and the first really big party we threw;
