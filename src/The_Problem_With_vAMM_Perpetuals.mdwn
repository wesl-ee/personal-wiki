Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a staple of nearly every
[[DeFi|Digital_Money/Decentralized_Finance]] blockchain
worth mentioning. Show me a DeFi chain without an AMM and I will show you a
chain that needs an AMM. Where on a centralized exchange (CEX) a Central Limit
Order Book (CLOB) pairs market-makers with market-takers, an AMM is the sole
market-maker for all traders. AMMs are inefficient compared with orderbooks,
because each trader experiences AMM slippage. I think of slippage as a "premium"
you must pay for the benefits of decentralization.

The size of the premium you pay in slippage is a function of both your trade
size and the amount of liquidity in the curve. Namely for any trade the slippage
premium is large for (a) large trades and (b) low liquidity in the curve.

AMMs are well-understood, and the constant-product curve above is just one of
many different flavors of AMM curve. One of the coolest things I know about AMMs
is that a [2012 Minecraft
plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/hyperconomy/pages/information)
was the first use of a constant-product curve for pricing an item.

What are Perpetual Futures?
---------------------------

[[!wikipedia Perpetual_Futures]] (perps for short) are derivatives which lack an
expiry date and which grant exposure to the underlying by incentivizing traders
to keep the price of the derivative in-line with the underlying asset. They are
designed to mimic futures contracts which are continuously rolled over, thereby
never reaching expiry. At no point does the trader need to actually custody the
underlying asset: one can trade BTC.USD perpetuals without buying spot Bitcoin.

Perpetual exchanges have an internal "mark" price that is distinct from the spot
price of an asset. The mark price is how much a representation of the asset is
trading for on the futures exchange itself. If I tank the price on a perpetual
futures exchange the price of the asset on the spot market is unaffected. To
incentivize traders to bring the mark price back in-line with the spot price the
protocol pays a "funding rate" to traders taking a long position. If the mark
price were above spot price, funding would be paid to shorts. Thereby the price
of a perpetual future product roughly tracks the price of the underlying.

And one important thing to remember about perpetual futures before we dig in
further is that perps are ideally zero-sum: every 1 USDC that you make from a
trade is 1 USDC that another trader lost. If a trader loses too much s/he is
liquidated, meaning their collateral (USDC) is sold and their position is closed
forcefully. If a trader owes more than the amount of USDC that is
collateralizing that position then the position is underwater and the deficit is
made up by the protocol. This is termed "bad debt" and is subsidized by an
insurance fund. In Perpetual Protocol's case $PERP tokens are sold to cover the
debt, and other vAMM exchanges do a similar thing to cover debt.

For instance if I leverage 100 USDC 10x then I am given 1000 vUSDC. If ETH is
trading at 1000 USDC then I can buy 1 vETH. Should the market move 10% to the
downside then my 1 ETH is now worth only 900 vUSDC. I have lost my 100 USDC and
should be liquidated to pay the traders who went short.

Generally, a 10x leveraged long position with 0 profit + loss (PnL) should be
liquidated when the market moves more than 10% to the downside. In reality it
will be liquidated sooner because protocols often enforce a "safety margin" as
liquidations will not happen instantly. Without a safety margin the protocol
risks losing more money than it can collect from an overleveraged trader and
thereby risks incurring bad debt.

Virtual AMMs
------------

AMMs work great for spot markets. Can we use an AMMs market-making ability to
build on-chain perpetual futures? Yes! That's exactly what
[Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/) pioneered in their v1 by using a virtual
AMM (vAMM) as their market maker. The idea is the same as an AMM except that
both tokens are virtual and are minted solely by the protocol itself. In the
case of Perpetual Protocol (v2) traders receive vUSDC representing their
notional position (notional size is `margin * leverage` plus any profits /
losses). Traders can then swap these vUSDC for vBTC (or vETH etc) on a Uniswap
v3 AMM that is instantiated by Perpetual Protocol.

What makes these vAMMs inefficient compared to a pure orderbook model as you
would see on a CEX is: slippage.

<figure>

<figcaption><em><a href="https://youtu.be/dRhRFOu-hRA">Slippage! Slippage, Eli!
Drained dry, you boy</a></em></figcaption>
</figure>

Recall that for a given trade slippage is determined by exactly two things:

1. The notional size of the trade
2. The amount of liquidity in the AMM curve

If I sell into an AMM I will cause the mark price to slip above or below the
spot price. The more the price slips the less USDC I receive. If ETH trades for
1000 USDC, the most efficient perpetuals market allows me to sell 1 ETH for 1000
USDC.

Unlike with traditional AMMs we can mint as much vUSDC and vBTC as we like and
provide this as liquidity. By increasing liquidity in the vAMM we decrease
slippage.  This is one way we can artificially control vAMM slippage.  Exactly
*how much* virtual liquidity to provide is a difficult problem, however, because
traders can lever their capital as much or as little as they'd like: what is
"acceptable" slippage for 100,000 vUSDC may not be acceptable for only 100
vUSDC. Some systems, like Drift protocol, dynamically adjust this liquidity in
an interesting twist called a dynamic virtual AMM (DAMM).

Slippage is necessary in a vAMM because without it the price of the asset in the
vAMM would not move. But if liquidity is too low large trades may move the
market too much. Low liquidity also allows traders to manipulate the market
easily. If I have 100,000 USDC and lever this 10x to make a notional size of 1MM
vUSDC, and that 1MM USDC can move a market by 10%, I could easily wipe out all
other 10x leverage positions by (1) buying vBTC with vUSDC (2) liquidating all
now-overleveraged positions and (3) selling my vBTC. In addition to collecting
liquidation incentives I have also profited by forcing traders to close their
positions, allowing me to sell my vBTC for more than what I acquired it with.

This flow could be bundled into a single transaction, thereby making it
impossible to sandwich any of these steps. With 100k USDC I now have access to
risk-free, guaranteed profit at the expense of 10x leveraged participants. Poor
you!

Manipulation is destructive for any market, so as a decentralized perpetuals
exchange running a vAMM I want to prevent this. But who's to say 100k USDC is "a
lot" of USDC? I could easily be a participant with 1MM USDC or more.  Because
this is a risk-free yield strategy I can borrow as much USDC as I possibly can
and complete this flow as many times as I want to earn a stable return on my
USDC for free.

Perpetual protocol "solved" this by introducing a price TWAP and a 10% rule: if
the spot price of an asset and its "mark" (virtual) price diverge by more than
10% then the spot price is used for calculating if a position is liquidatable.
And sure, this reduces the profitibility of such a strategy. But to understand
why this is bad consider first that positions are liquidated when they are
at-risk of having bad debt. If I close a position when I am underwater, the
protocol loses money. Even better, if I *cause the bad debt myself* then I can
profit from this by draining the protocol's insurance fund.

vAMM Initial Conditions
-----------------------

A direct consequence of forcing perpetuals to be a zero-sum game is that, should
every position be closed, the mark price will return to its initial state. So if
I bootstrapped a Bitcoin perpetual swap at 5,000 USDC per BTC, and the BTC price
soared to 70,000 USDC per BTC, traders exiting their long positions will need to
be replaced by new longs to keep the price at 70,000 USDC per. If no fresh
capital arrives and every trader closed his / her long position, the mark price
will plummet back to 5,000 USDC per BTC regardless of the spot price of BTC. As
stated before, the protocol will pay (out-of-pocket, mind you) a funding rate to
incentivize new traders to take the long position.  If this continues then the
protocol will bleed its insurance fund until it is empty, at which point the
protocol is insolvent.

For an asset that trends up over time this means that if you want to exit a
large position in profit you must convince someone to buy your bag. This is the
definition of PvP trading, and such schemes often collapse when everyone runs
for the exit.

You can think of the initial conditions of a vAMM as a pin, and the mark price as a
rubberband wrapped around this pin. You can stretch the mark price out quite
far, but eventually either the mark price must return to the pin or the pin must
be moved closer to the mark price.

<figcaption>The further we are from initial conditions, the more capital we need
to prop up the system</figcaption>
</figure>

Considering all of this, it is clear that traditional vAMM perps cannot "unwind"
safely when the underlying asset trends up with time. DeFi perpetuals either
[explode
violently](https://driftprotocol.medium.com/drift-protocol-technical-incident-report-2022-05-11-eedea078b6d4?source=rss-7075db3c6335------2)
or quietly go bankrupt. There is no safe end-of-life for a pure vAMM perpetual
swap as it must accomplish the impossible task of attracting more capital
indefinitely. This is why they tend to topple over when put under stress,
because everyone cannot redeem without returning to initial conditions,
which bankrupts the protocol.

Drift protocol had the ability to repeg the stablepoint to the current mark
price but this cost is subsidized by the protocol and is not very attractive, as
you're simply providing exit liquidity to traders at the expense of the
protocol, which is what happens even without repegging by way of funding
payments.

Safe, Open, Permissionless Perpetuals
-------------------------------------

The vAMM model produces a protocol that does not pass the test of being able to
[wind down slowly](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/05/25/stable.html). Using a
pure orderbook model would allow a protocol to wind down safely, but
unfortunately running an on-chain matching engine is computationally complex.
Off-loading the matching to a "private blockchain" is no better than running a
CEX orderbook as it gives protocol insiders the ability to front-run orders.

Minimizing the need to trust a central authority is key. If you don't care about
"trust" then just trade perpetuals on a CEX; the beauty of blockchain is its
transparency and permissionlessness, both of which are destroyed if you allow
one party to match orders behind closed doors.

Designing a new, safe, stable protocol that lets traders enter and exit the
market freely, exchanging futures around the current spot price, and without fear
of being forcibly liquidated or "stopped out" by a whale or a market-maker is
one of the interesting problems I had the pleasure of working on with the
Levana team.
