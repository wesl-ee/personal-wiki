[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” NOS Sonic Sour"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

High Performance Energy. Enhanced Mental Focus. CMPLX6. It's NOS. But not the
[[original one|NOS]]. This one is NOS Sonic Sour, delivered in a green can. I
can already guess what it tastes like before I even open it.

Sonic Sour is not as aggressive as the OG. Throughout, the taste is like green
apple Jolly Ranchers. It touts a notably sour taste on the tongue that lingers a
bit after downing a sip. It's very yummy if not a little harsh and not as easy
to drink as some other energy drinks. That's in part due to the heavy-handed
dose of citric acid that lends it the sour part of the sour apple taste. Still,
probably my favorite NOS that is not the OG flavor.
