Between time of the release of Red Bull in the US in 1996 and the formation of
Rockstar in 2001 and Monster Energy in 2002, the US thirst for energy drinks
went from nonexistent to red hot.

Pushed further by insane bids on behalf of Monster Energy and Red Bull, energy
drinks forced their way into the US public consciousness around this time. Red
Bull heavily sponsored Sauber Motorsport AG in F1 races from 1995 until 2005
when it purchased _it's own F1 team_, formerly Jaguar Racing, from Ford. Monster
Energy pushed its _rockstar_ image by handing out cans at rock concerts, and it
became a sponsor of Vans Warped Tour in 2003 [^1]. Rip-It secured a contract with
the US Department of Defense in 2004 to provide energy drinks in 8oz cans to US
troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Monster, Red Bull and Rockstar formed the triumvirate of top 3 energy drinks by
sales volume by 2007. Here is a snapshot of the market that year, by brand.

I argue that, following this period of massive revenue + explosive growth, the
decade from 2011 to 2021 was a dark-age for energy drinks, due to the natural
contraction and concentration of the market and to these special two factors.

Factor One: Four Loko
---------------------

In 2010 we see the reformulation of Four Loko, a caffeinated, canned, alcoholic
malt beverage packaged between 6% and 14% ABV, sold by Phusion Projects. I'd
argue that the public hysteria around caffeine plus alcohol, and consequent FDA
warnings issued to Phusion Projects and other caffeinated malt producers,
spooked the market as more Americans became aware of the dangers of not just
mixing caffeine and alcohol, but of caffeine ingested on its own. Outlets state
that the inclusion of caffeine makes consumers feel "wide-awake drunk" and makes
them act out of character. This gives Four Loko a cult-like status. Many
publicized incidents from late-2010 involve people drinking more than one can of
Four Loko. If these were just normal 6% to 14% ABV malts this event would not be
newsworthy but the hysteria surrounding the "alcohol plus caffeine death
cocktail" I believe tainted the perception of caffeinated, carbonated energy
drinks, as many outlets state it was the caffeine that made people do stupid
stuff, not the amount of alcohol and often the mixing of Four Loko with other
(non-malt) liquors.

There were a few producers of caffeinated malts in the US at the time. In the
Four Loko case, as the result of several widely publicized incidents, injuries
and probably 1 death, Four Loko was banned across many college campuses and at
the state level in some cases, with the hysteria peaking in October and November 2010.
In November 2010 the FDA publicly warned the producers of caffeinated
alcoholic beverages, Phusion Projects included, that caffeine may be an unsafe
food additive in their products; Four-Loko was reformulated to remove the
caffeine in December of the same year in compliance with this FDA guidance.

Factor Two: Michelle Obama
--------------------------

Another factor which hurt energy drink sales during this time was the begin of
the acceleration of the decline of per-capita sugary drink consumption. From
2007 to 2008 US sugary drink consumptuion fell 1.8% and continued to fall as
childhood obesity became a defining issue of this time in the US, highlighted
and bookended by Michelle Obama's Let's Move program in 2010. Energy drinks,
which had few sugar-free formulas at this time, suffered as a result of the
downturn in US public perception.

---

The industry entered into an intermission where new introductions into the
category slumped, brands were pulled from shelves and power was centralized in
larger market participants. Here is a list of companies that sold the bottom:

- Coca-Cola, who bought NOS in 2007 from Fuze, sold the brand to Monster Energy in
2015
- Coca-Cola also dumped the Powerade Energy brand in 2013
- SoBe No Fear / Adrenaline Rush distribution was scaled back heavily in the US
  market
    - As of 2024 a company in Guatamala produces Adrenaline Rush, without the
      SoBe branding, under just the name "Adrenaline Rush" with the subtext
      "bebida energizente"
- Mtn Dew experiments with Game Fuel and removes the Mountain Dew logo from Amp
  cans entirely
    - In 2018 Mtn Dew pulled a 180 and un-rebranded it back to "Mountain Dew Amp" again

Shareholder presentations from this time confirm that, in addition to the
concerns about sugar content, companies are aware that consumers living in
what I propose as the post-caffeinated Four Loko society are more aware of the
risks of caffeine on health [^3].

In the background of the 10 years from 2011 〜 2021, something was brewing. I
believe the market saw the trends of sugary drink consumption and realized that
dumping high-fructose corn syrup into an energy drink was not sustainable if the
trend continued (and it has). Although there were a few zero- or low-sugar
energy drinks available, the field was still budding in these years. The first
sign of life we see is a product from Monster called:

| Item | Launch Date |
|------|-------------|
| Monster Energy Zero Ultra | Q3 2012 |

The Monster Zero Ultra (white can) launched in Q3 2012 without much fanfare from
the company. Immediately after hitting shelves though the drink becomes an
instant success. By 2014 the barely 2 year-old line is Monster's #2 sub brand
and Zero Ultra in particular is Monster's #2 SKU [^4]. Prior to Zero Ultra the
only entries in Monster's low / zero sugar category were Monster Lo-Carb and
Monster Absolutely Zero, which saw limited success but failed to hit the mark as
well as Zero Ultra did.

Monster scales up the Ultra line quickly, trying to capture more of the market
that Ultra Zero tapped in to before anyone else can.

With the sugar concern mostly solved through zero-sugar offerings, the only
problem now was looming public concern about caffeine, and a lack of clear FDA
guidance about safe and healthy caffeine dosing by age.

In 2014, 2 cases of death by overdosing caffeine anhydrous are recorded and
further stoke public fear of caffeine. Another death in 2017 (not anhydrous)
causes the FDA to look more closely into the issue.

Then, in April 2018 the FDA issues guidance about caffeine, effectively limiting
the sale of anhydrous caffeine, and around the same time began prescribing
adults with no special heart conditions to stay below 400mg of caffeine / day
[^5].

This guidance, I believe, was the final domino that let the energy drink market
flourish again. It took a wave of newcomers to the space, mostly from the
athletic supplements (preworkout) fields, to reenergize the old guard, but now
in 2024 we enjoy the consequences of those actions as the benefactors of the
current energy drink renaissance.

Amid the growing hype, the old triumvirate of Rockstar, Monster Energy and
Rockstar became 2 when Pespi acquired Rockstar for 3.85 billion USD in cash on
in April 2020 [^6].

### 2024 Energy Drink Brands By Market Share [^7]

| Brand | Market Share (including energy shots) |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| Red Bull | 34.6 |
| Monster Energy | 30.6 |
| Celsius | 8.5 |
| C4 | 3.7 |
| Five Hour Energy | 3.3 |
| Rockstar | 3 |
| Ghost | 3 |
| Bang | 1.6 |
| Reign | 3.1 |
| NOS | 2.6 |
| Full Throttle | 0.7 |

It's worth noting that more energy drink brands emerged from the world of
preworkout supplements than during the 2000s boom. Ghost, C4 and some incumbents
not on this list like Bucked Up, Lit and Alani Nu were preworkout powders before
or around the same time that they were reformulated and sold in cans.

And speaking of products not on the above market share list, honorable mentions
here are 3D Energy and Prime Energy, both of which are owned alongside Alani Nu
by Congo Brands, a company that seems as much a digital marketing machine as an
energy drink distributor.

| Item | Launch Date |
| Reign | March 2019 |
| Ghost Energy | 2021 |
| Prime Energy | January 2023 |
| Monser Zero Sugar | January 2023 |
| Nos Zero Sugar | 2023 |

Dan Lourenco, the founder of Ghost described the current energy drink market as
being "on fire" [^8]. I couldn't agree more.
