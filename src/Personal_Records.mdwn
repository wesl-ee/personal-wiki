Tracking personal records (PRs) is useful for gauging [[Phyiscal_Fitness]]
progress. For me there is no goal and there is no end. It's just fun to watch
the numbers go up!

These are my most up-to-date ORs. The big three (squat, press and deadlift) are
the most-tracked lifts, but I've listed lifts which are tracked less often here
too.

| | Best | Calculated 1RM |
| Squat | 195lb x7 | 234lb |
| Bench Press | 155lb x5 | 174lb |
| Deadlift | 225lb x6 | 261lb |
| Leg Press | 270lb x8 | 335lb |
| Dumbbell Curl | 35lb x6 | 41lb |
| Lat Pulldown | 120lb x10 | 160lb |
| Cable Row | 100lb x10 | 133lb |
