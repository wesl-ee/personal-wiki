Tracking personal records (PRs) is useful for gauging [[Physical_Fitness]]
progress. For me there is no goal and there is no end. It's just fun to watch
the numbers go up!

These are my most up-to-date PRs. The big three (squat, press and deadlift) are
the most-tracked lifts, but I've listed lifts which are tracked less often here
too. Alongside them, if the PR is not for 1 rep, then I've listed an estimated
1-rep max (1RM) using the Brzycki method. Estimations are not always accurate
but give a good guess as to what weight I could lift for 1 rep. But because
testing a 1RM is exhausting and 1 is not in the ideal rep range for a workout I
rarely if ever test my 1RM.

| Bench Press | 155lb x5 | 174lb[^1] |
| Deadlift | 225lb x6 | 261lb[^1] |
| Leg Press | 270lb x8 | 335lb[^1] |
| Dumbbell Curl | 35lb x6 | 41lb[^1] |
