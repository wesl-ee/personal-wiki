I've never seen this canned latte before today at the Dollar Tree which always
carries weird stuff. Visually the can is nothing special, just black text on a
baby blue background. The back of the can says it is a product of Turkey.

My bar for canned coffee is pretty high, but this coffee scores well above it.
It has a creamy texture; there's a distinct coffee taste on the front, with
vague chocolate notes towards the end and a very clear cocounut taste
throughout. All together this tastes like a Mounds bar.

The can is a tad small for canned coffee here in the US at 11.2oz but it is
enough volume to be enjoyable to sip on. The exact caffeine content is unclear
but the back hints that it's probably ~120mg, somewhere between what they call
"medium" and "strong" latte.
