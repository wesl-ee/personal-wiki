[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Full Throttle"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Full Throttle was a Coke product before it was sold to Monster in 2015 when they
reconciled their energy and non-energy offerings. Monster gave Coke Peace Tea
among other things at the time. There are only two flavors right now: Original
(this one) and [[Full_Throttle_True_Blue|True Blue]].

Citrus. The taste reminds me of the gummy worms they sell at convenience stores,
not like the sour worms but the waxy ones. The drink is very sugary as well and
I would not recommend to have more than ocasionally if you're not big on added
sugar as there are 55g of it (230 calories) in a can. With 160mg of caffeine
drinking one is more reminiscent of older energy drinks than of the sugar-free,
200 or 300mg things they make now.

Although it's been around for a long time (2004) with few changes the first I
can remember trying Full Throttle was in 2022 in Chicago for
[[Millennium_Strike_Prologue]].

The taste stands out, I like it a lot. Even so, Full Throttle has a time and
place for me. I enjoy these, along with about any other drink that has a
non-negligible amount of sugar, normally before a workout or on days where I
have a caloric deficit I didn't mean to have.
