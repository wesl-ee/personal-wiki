[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Full Throttle"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Full Throttle was a Coke product before it was sold to Monster in 2015 when they
reconciled their energy and non-energy offerings. Monster gave Coke Peace Tea
among other things at the time.

Citrus. The taste reminds me of the gummy worms they sell at convenience stores,
not like the sour worms but the waxy ones. The drink is very sugary as well and
I would not recommend to have more than ocasionally if you're not big on added
sugar as there are 55g of it (230 calories) in a can. With 160mg of caffeine
drinking one is more reminiscent of older energy drinks than of the sugar-free,
200 or 300mg things they make now.

Although it's been around for a long time (2006) with few changes the first I
can remember trying Full Throttle was in 2022 in Chicago.

The taste stands out, I like it a lot. Even so, Full Throttle has a time and
place for me. I enjoy these, along with about any other drink that has a
non-negligible amount of sugar, normally before a workout or on days where I
have a caloric deficit I didn't mean to have.
