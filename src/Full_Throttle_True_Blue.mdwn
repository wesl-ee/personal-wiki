[[!meta title="Energy Drink â€” Full Throttle True Blue"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Easy Drinking. Hard Working. Full Throttle, presently a Monster Energy brand has
two flavors: [[Original|Full_Throttle]] and True Blue. There _were_ more but
these are lost to time. The ones I've found reviews for are:

- [Blue Demon](https://everyview.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/review-full-throttle-blue-demon/)
- [Fury](https://everyview.wordpress.com/2008/11/05/review-full-throttle-fury/)
- [Orange](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2017/06/full-throttle-orange-energy-drink-review.html)
- [Citrus](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2009/12/full-throttle-citrus.html)
- [Red Berry](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2011/05/full-throttle-red-berry-energy-drink.html)
- [Caramel](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2010/08/full-throttle-caramel-energy-coffee.html) (coffee)
- [Mocha Energy](https://caffeineking101.blogspot.com/2010/06/full-throttle-mocha-energy-coffee.html) (coffee)

They've also redesigned the original and blue agave flavors ~3 times over
its rather long 21-year existence. I love Full Throttle but I doubt it will last
for much longer. Its longevity is already surprising enough. I think someone's
just forgot about it.

Unsurprisingly the taste is very close to the original [[Full_Throttle]] with
less citrus, more notes of fruit. Like cranberry. It no longer reminds me as
strongly of sour gummy worms as the original does; much duller flavor; it is a
mild taste but, although the can promises this, it doesn't particularly taste
like blue agave.
