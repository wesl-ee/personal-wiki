[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Rip It G-Force"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

There are so many Rip It flavors and none of the names make sense. Like
[[Stinger-Mo|Rip_It_Stinger-Mo]], [[Tribute C.Y.P.-X|Rip_It_Tribute_C.Y.P.-X]]
and [[F Bomb|Rip_It_F_Bomb]], _G-Force_ barely betrays anything of the taste.
Luckily it says "Grape" right there on the can under a bunch of grapes.

It tastes like artificial grape; almost 1:1 with Grape Fanta. The carbonation
serves the flavor well, when it's flat it tastes like a melted grape freeze pop.
For $1.49, like all Rip Its, this is a decent value proposition, but comes at
the cost of 48g of sugar.
