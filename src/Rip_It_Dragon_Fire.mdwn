[[!meta title="Energy Drink Review â€” Rip It Dragon Fire"]]
[[!tag Energy_Drink Review]]

Dragon Fire is a Rip It flavor I've never seen for sale in-person. I acquired
this can and 95 others with the magic of the Internet and by the end of the
weekend after I got them they were almost all gone; that is, with the help of 50
or 60 friends and friends of friends.

Dragon Fire tastes vaguely like cinnamon or clove. It is a very dull variety of
cinnamon flavor that I did not expect when the can colorway suggested a far
spicier one. There's nothing exciting going on here and nothing redeems this
one. The finish is very boring, almost tasting like one of the off-brand sodas
they sell at grocery stores. Like many other Rip Its this leaves a sticky
residue on my mouth, reminding me of how much corn syrup is in this. 49g of
sugar and 160mg of caffeine.

I would not recommend.
